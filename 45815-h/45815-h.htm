<h2 title="To The Reader."
id="to-the-reader">TO THE READER.</h2>

<p class="chap-first">In publishing this story of a great and overwhelming
calamity, which fell upon England in common with the
rest of Europe, in the middle of the fourteenth century, I
desire to record my grateful thanks to those who have in
any way assisted me in gathering together my material, or
in weaving it into a connected narrative. Amongst these
many kind friends I may specially name Mr. F. Bickley, of
the British Museum, Mr. F.J. Baigent, the Rev. Prebendary
Hingeston-Randolph, and, above all, Mr. Edmund Bishop,
to whom I am greatly indebted for advice, criticism, and
ever-patient assistance in revising the proof-sheets.</p>

<h2 title="Introduction.">
<a id="introduction"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<div class="xxpn">[p-xiii]</div>

<p class="chap-first">The story of the Great Pestilence of 1348–9 has never been
fully told. In fact, until comparatively recent times, little
attention was paid to an event which, nevertheless, whether
viewed in the magnitude of the catastrophe, or in regard to
its far-reaching results, is certainly one of the most important
in the history of our country.</p>

<p>Judged by the ordinary manuals, the middle of the fourteenth
century appears as the time of England's greatest
glory. Edward III. was at the very height of his renown.
The crushing defeat of France at Crecy, in 1346, followed
the next year by the taking of Calais, had raised him to the
height of his fame. When, wearing the laurels of the most
brilliant victory of the age, he landed at Sandwich, on
October 14th, 1347, the country, or at least the English
courtiers, seemed intoxicated by the success of his arms.
"A new sun," says the chronicler Walsingham, "seemed to
have arisen over the people, in the perfect peace, in the
plenty of all things, and in the glory of such victories.
<span class="xxpn">[p-xiv]</span> There was hardly a woman of any name who did not possess
spoils of Caen, Calais and other French towns across the
sea;" and the English matrons proudly decked themselves
with the rich dresses and costly ornaments carried off from
foreign households. This was, moreover, the golden era of
chivalry, and here and there throughout the country tournaments
celebrated with exceptional pomp the establishment
of the Order of the Garter, instituted by King Edward
to perpetuate the memory of his martial successes. It is
little wonder, then, that the Great Pestilence, now known
as the "Black Death," coming as it does between Crecy
and Poitiers, and at the very time of the creation of the
first Knights of the Garter, should seem to fall aside from
the general narrative as though something apart from, and
not consonant with, the natural course of events.</p>

<p>It is accordingly no matter for wonder that a classic like
Hume, in common with our older writers on English history,
should have dismissed the calamity in a few lines; but a
reader may well feel surprise at finding that the late Mr. J.
R. Green, who saw deeper into causes and effects than his
predecessors, deals with the great epidemic in a scanty
notice only as a mere episode in his account of the agricultural
changes in the fourteenth century. Although he
speaks generally of the death of one-half the population
through the disease, he evidently has not realised the
enormous effects, social and religious, which are directly
traceable to the catastrophe.</p>

<p>Excellent articles, indeed, such as those from the pen of
<span class="xxpn">[p-xv]</span> Professor Seebohm and Dr. Jessop, and chance pages in
books on political and social economy, like those of the
late Professor Thorold Rogers and Dr. Cunningham, have
done much in our time to draw attention to the importance
of the subject. Still, so far as I am aware,
no writer has yet treated the plague as a whole, or,
indeed, has utilised the material available for forming
a fairly accurate estimate of its ravages. The collections
for the present study had been entirely made
when a book on the <em class="e000I2">Epidemics in Britain</em>, by Dr.
Creighton, was announced, and, as a consequence, the
work was set aside. On the appearance of Dr. Creighton's
volume, however, it was found that, whilst treating
this pestilence at considerable length as a portion of
his general subject, not merely had it not entered into
his design to utilise the great bulk of material to be
found in the various records of the period, but the
author had dealt with the matter from a wholly different
point of view.</p>

<p>It is proper, therefore, to state why a detailed treatment
of a subject, in itself so uninviting, is here undertaken.
The pestilence of 1348–49, for its own sake, must
necessarily be treated by the professional writer as an item
in the general series of epidemics; but there are many
reasons why it has never been dealt with in detail from the
mere point of view of the historian. Yet an adequate
realisation of its effects is of the first importance for the
right understanding of the history of England in the later
<span class="xxpn">[p-xvi]</span> Middle Ages. The "Black Death" inflicted what can only
be called a wound deep in the social body, and produced
nothing less than a revolution of feeling and practice,
especially of religious feeling and practice. Unless this is
understood, from the very circumstances of the case, we
shall go astray in our interpretation of the later history of
England. In truth, this great pestilence was a turning
point in the national life. It formed the real close of the
Mediæval period and the beginning of our Modern age. It
produced a break with the past, and was the dawn of a new
era. The sudden sweeping away of the population and the
consequent scarcity of labourers, raised, it is well recognised,
new and extravagant expectations in the minds of
the lower classes; or, to use a modern expression, labour
began then to understand its value and assert its power.</p>

<p>But there is another and yet more important result of
the pestilence which, it would seem, is not sufficiently
recognised. To most people, looking back into the past,
the history of the Church during the Middle Ages in England
appears one continuous and stately progress. It is
much nearer to the truth to say that in 1351 the whole
ecclesiastical system was wholly disorganised, or, indeed,
more than half ruined, and that everything had to be built
up anew. As regards education, the effect of the catastrophe
on the body of the clergy was prejudicial beyond
the power of calculation. To secure the most necessary
public ministrations of the rites of religion the most inadequately-prepared
subjects had to be accepted, and even
<span class="xxpn">[p-xvii]</span> these could be obtained only in insufficient numbers. The
immediate effect on the people was a religious paralysis.
Instead of turning men to God the scourge turned them to
despair, and this not only in England, but in all parts of
Europe. Writers of every nation describe the same dissoluteness
of manners consequent upon the epidemic. In
time the religious sense and feeling revived, but in many
respects it took a new tone, and its manifestations ran in
new channels. If the change is to be described in brief, I
should say that the religion of Englishmen, as it now manifested
itself on the recovery of religion, and as it existed
from that time to the Reformation, was characterised by a
devotional and more self-reflective cast than previously.
This is evidenced in particular by the rise of a whole school
of spiritual writers, the beginnings of which had been
already manifested in the writings of Hampole, himself a
victim of the plague. It was subsequently developed by
such writers as Walter Hilton and the authors of a mass of
anonymous tracts, still in manuscript, which, in so far as
they have attracted notice at all, have been commonly set
down under the general designation of <em class="e000I2">Wycliffite</em>. The
reason for this misleading classification is not difficult to
understand. Finding on the one hand that these
tracts are pervaded by a deeply religious spirit, and
on the other being convinced that the religion of
those days was little better than a mere formalism,
the few persons who have hitherto paid attention to
the subject have not hesitated to attribute them to the
<span class="xxpn">[p-xviii]</span> "religious revival of the Lollards," and were naturally
unable to believe them to be inspired by the teaching of
"a Church shrivelled into a self-seeking secular priesthood."<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
The reader, who has a practical and personal experience
of the tone, spirit, and teaching of works of
Catholic piety, will, however, at once recognise that these
tracts are perfect Catholic in tone, spirit, and doctrine, and
differ essentially from those of men inspired by the teaching
of Wycliffe.</p>

<p>The new religious spirit found outward expression in
the multitude of guilds which sprang into existence at this
time, in the remarkable and almost, as it may seem to
some, extravagant development of certain pious practices,
in the singular spread of a more personal devotion to the
Blessed Sacrament, to the Blessed Virgin, to the Five
Wounds, to the Holy Name, and other such manifestations
of a more tender or more familiar piety. Even the very
adornment and enrichment of the churches, so distinctive
of this period, bears witness to the change. At the close of
the fourteenth century and during the course of the fifteenth
the supply of ornaments, furniture, plate, statues painted
or in highly decked "coats," with which the churches were
literally encumbered as time went on, proved a striking
contrast to the comparative simplicity which characterised
former days, as witnessed by a comparison of inventories.
Moreover, the source of all this wealth and elaboration is
<span class="xxpn">[p-xvix]</span> another indication of the change that had come over the
country. Benefactions to the Church are no longer contributed
entirely, or at least chiefly, by the great nobles,
but they are now the gifts of the burgher folk and middle
classes, and this very profusion corresponds, according to
the ideas and feelings of those days, to the abundant
material comfort which from the early years of the last
century to the present has specially characterised the
English homes of modern times. In fact, the fifteenth
century witnessed the beginnings of a great middle-class
movement, which can be distinctly traced to the effect of
the great pestilence, and which, whether for good or for
evil, was checked by the change of religion in the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p>It is sufficient here to have indicated in the most general
way the change which took place in the religious life of
the English people and the new tendencies which manifested
themselves. If the later religious history of the
country is to be understood it is necessary to take this
catastrophe, social and religious, as a starting-point, and
to bring home to the mind the part the Black Death really
played in the national history.</p>

<p>Merely to report what is said of England would tend to
raise in the mind of the reader a certain incredulity. A
short and rapid review has accordingly been made of the
progress of the pestilence from Eastern Europe to these
Western shores, and by this means the very distressing
unanimity, even to definite forms of language, of writers
<span class="xxpn">[p-xx]</span> who recorded events hundreds and even thousands of miles
apart, brings home the reality of the catastrophe with
irresistible force. The story, so far as England is concerned,
is told at greater length, and the progress of the
disease is followed as it swept from south to north and
passed on to higher latitudes. The state of the country
after the pestilence was over is then briefly described,
and attention is called to some of the immediate results
of the great plague, especially as bearing upon the Church
life of the country.</p>

<a id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.
<span class="smaller">THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE EPIDEMIC.</span></h2>

<p class="chap-first">The Great Pestilence, which first reached Europe in
the autumn of 1347, is said to have originated in the East
some three or four years previously. So far as actual
history goes, however, the progress of the disease can be
traced only from the ports of the Black Sea and possibly
from those of the Mediterranean, to which traders along
the main roads of commerce with Asiatic countries
brought their merchandise for conveyance to the Western
world. Reports at the time spoke of great earthquakes and
other physical disturbances as having taken place in the
far East, and these were said to have been accompanied by
peculiar conditions of the atmosphere, and followed by a
great mortality among the teeming populations of India
and China. Pope Clement VI. was informed that the pestilence
then raging at Avignon had had its origin in the East,
and that, in the countries included under that vague name,
the infection had spread so rapidly, and had proved to be
so deadly, that the victims were calculated at the enormous,
and no doubt exaggerated, number of nearly four-and-twenty
millions.</p>

<p>A Prague chronicle speaks of the epidemic in the kingdoms
of China, India, and Persia, and the contemporary
historian, Matteo Villani, reports its conveyance to Europe
by Italian traders, who had fled before it from the ports on
the eastern shores of the Black Sea. The same authority
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p002"></a>[p002]</span> corroborates, by the testimony of one who had been an eye-witness
in Asia, the reports of certain Genoese merchants
as to earthquakes devastating the continent and pestilential
fogs covering the land. "A venerable friar minor of
Florence, now a bishop, declared," so says Villani, "that
he was then in that part of the country at the city of
Lamech, where by the violence of the shock part of the
temple of Mahomet was thrown down."<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>A quotation from Hecker's "Epidemics of the Middle
Ages" will be a sufficient summary of what was reported of
the plague in eastern countries before its arrival in Europe.
"Cairo lost daily, when the plague was raging with its
greatest violence, from 10 to 15,000, being as many as, in
modern times, great plagues have carried off during their
whole course. In China more than thirteen millions are
said to have died, and this is in correspondence with the
certainly exaggerated accounts from the rest of Asia. India
was depopulated. Tartary, Mesopotamia, Syria, Armenia
were covered with dead bodies; the Kurds fled in vain to
the mountains. In Caramania and Cæsarea none were left
alive. On the roads, in the camps, in the caravansaries unburied
bodies were alone to be seen.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. In Aleppo 500
died daily; 22,000 people and most of the animals were
carried off in Gaza within six weeks. Cyprus lost almost
all its inhabitants; and ships without crews were often seen
in the Mediterranean, as afterwards in the North Sea,
driving about and spreading the plague wherever they went
ashore."<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>There can be little doubt that the contagion was first
spread by means of the great trade routes of the East. The
lines of commerce of European countries with India, China,
and Asiatic countries generally are first definitely described
in 1321 by Marino Sanudo, a Venetian, in a work addressed
to Pope John XXI., not thirty years before the outbreak of
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p003"></a>[p003]</span> the pestilence.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> His object was to indicate the difficulties
and dangers which then beset the traffic of the mercantile
world with the East. In so doing he pointed out that the
ancient centre of all trade with the far East was Bagdad.
To and from this great depôt of Oriental merchandise all
the caravan routes led; but, at the time when Sanudo
wrote, the incursion of barbarian hordes into Central Asia
had rendered trade along these roads difficult and unsafe.
Two trading tracts are in particular named by the author as
the chief lines of communication. One ran from Bagdad
over the plains of Mesopotamia and Syria to Lycia,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> where
the goods were purchased by the Italian merchants. This,
the best known route, was the shortest by which the produce
of China and India could be conveyed to the European
markets; but in the fourteenth century it was the most
perilous. The second route also started from Bagdad, and
having followed the Tigris to its sources in Armenia, passed
on either to Trebizond and other ports of the Black Sea, or
taking the road from the Caspian, upon the other side of the
Caucasus, passed to the Genoese and other flourishing
Italian settlements in the Crimea.</p>

<p>A third route was, however, according to Sanudo, the
most used in his day because the least dangerous. By it
the produce of eastern lands was brought to Alexandria,
whence, after having been heavily taxed by the Sultan, it
was transported to Europe. Merchandise coming to Italy
and other countries by this route from India was, according
to the same authority, shipped from two ports of the
peninsula, which he calls Mahabar<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
and Cambeth.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Thence
it was conveyed to ports in the Persian Gulf, to the river
Tigris, or to Aden, at the entrance of the Red Sea. From
this last point a journey of nine days across the desert
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p004"></a>[p004]</span> brought the caravans to a city called Chus<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> on the Nile.
Fifteen days more of river carriage, however, was required
before the produce of the Eastern marts reached Cairo, or
Babylon, as it was called by mediæval writers. From Cairo
it was conveyed to Alexandria by canal.</p>

<p>These were the three chief routes by which communication
between Asiatic countries and Europe was kept up, and
the markets of the Western world supplied with the spices,
gums, and silks of the East. It is more than probable that
the great pestilence was conveyed to Europe by the trading
caravans coming from the East by all these roads and by
other similar lines of commerce. In the country along one
of the trade routes, by which caravans reached the
Italian ports established on the Crimea, it is certain
that the plague was raging with great virulence in
1346, the year before its appearance in Europe. Moreover,
Gabriele de' Mussi, a notary of Piacenza, and an eye-witness
of the first outbreak of the plague in Upper Italy, has described
the way in which the infection was conveyed in the
ships of traders from Caffa,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> a Genoese settlement in the
Crimea. This account will be found in the next chapter;
and here it is only necessary to report what he gathered
from the survivors about the outbreak of the plague among
the Tartar tribes and its appearance at Caffa.<a
id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p005"></a>[p005]</span></p>

<p>"In the year 1346," he writes, "in eastern parts an
immense number of Tartars and Saracens fell victims to a
mysterious and sudden death. In these regions vast districts,
numerous provinces, magnificent kingdoms, cities,
castles, and villages, peopled by a great multitude, were
suddenly attacked by the mortality, and in a brief space
were depopulated. A place in the East called Tana,
situated in a northerly direction from Constantinople and
under the rule of the Tartars, to which Italian merchants
much resorted, was besieged by a vast horde of Tartars
and was in a short time taken."<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The Christian merchants
violently expelled from the city were then received for the
protection of their persons and property within the walls
of Caffa, which the Genoese had built in that country.</p>

<p>"The Tartars followed these fugitive Italian merchants,
and, surrounding the city of Caffa, besieged it likewise.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
Completely encircled by this vast army of enemies, the
inhabitants were hardly able to obtain the necessaries of
life, and their only hope lay in the fleet which brought
them provisions. Suddenly 'the death,' as it was called,
broke out in the Tartar host, and thousands were daily
carried off by the disease, as if "arrows from heaven were
striking at them and beating down their pride."</p>

<p>"At first the Tartars were paralysed with fear at the
ravages of the disease, and at the prospect that sooner or
later all must fall victims to it. Then they turned their
vengeance on the besieged, and in the hope of communicating
the infection to their Christian enemies, by the aid
of the engines of war, they projected the bodies of the
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p006"></a>[p006]</span> dead over the walls into the city. The Christian defenders,
however, held their ground, and committed as many of
these plague-infected bodies as possible to the waters of
the sea.</p>

<p>"Soon, as might be supposed, the air became tainted
and the wells of water poisoned, and in this way the
disease spread so rapidly in the city that few of the
inhabitants had strength sufficient to fly from it."<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>The further account of Gabriele de' Mussi describing
how a ship from Caffa conveyed the infection to
Genoa, from which it spread to other districts and cities
of Italy, must be deferred to the next chapter. Here
a short space may be usefully devoted to a consideration
of the disease itself, which proved so destructive to
human life in every European country in the years 1348–1350.
And, in the first place, it may be well to state that
the name <em class="e000I2">Black Death</em>, by which the great pestilence is
now generally known, not only in England, but elsewhere,
is of comparatively modern origin.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> In no contemporary
account of the epidemic is it called by that ominous title;
at the time people spoke of it as "the pestilence," "the
great mortality," "the death," "the plague of Florence,"
etc., and, apparently, not until some centuries later was it
given the name of "the Black Death." This it seems to
have first received in Denmark or Sweden, although it
is doubtful whether the <em class="e000I2">atra mors</em> of Pontanus is
equivalent to the English <em class="e000I2">Black Death</em>.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> It is hard to
resist the impression that in England, at least, it was used
as the recognised name for the epidemic of 1349 only after
the pestilence of the 17th century had assumed to itself
the title of the <em class="e000I2">Great Plague</em>. Whether the name <em class="e000I2">Black
Death</em> was first adopted to express the universal state of
mourning to which the disease reduced the people of all
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p007"></a>[p007]</span> countries, or to mark the special characteristic symptoms
of this epidemic, is, under the circumstances of its late
origin, unimportant to determine.</p>

<p>The epidemic would appear to have been some form of
the ordinary Eastern or bubonic plague. Together, however,
with the usual characteristic marks of the common
plague, there were certain peculiar and very marked
symptoms, which, although not universal, are recorded
very generally in European countries.</p>

<p>In its common form the disease showed itself in swellings
and carbuncles under the arm and in the groin. These
were either few and large—being at times as large as a
hen's egg—or smaller and distributed over the body of the
sufferer. In this the disease does not appear to have been
different from the ordinary bubonic plague, which ravaged
Europe during many centuries, and which is perhaps best
known in England as so destructive to human life in the
great plague of London in 1665. In this ordinary form it
still exists in Eastern countries, and its origin is commonly
traced to the method of burying the dead in vogue there.</p>

<p>The special symptoms characteristic of the plague of
1348–9 were four in number:—</p>

<p>(1) Gangrenous inflammation of the throat and lungs;</p>

<p>(2) Violent pains in the region of the chest;</p>

<p>(3) The vomiting and spitting of blood; and</p>

<p>(4) The pestilential odour coming from the bodies and
breath of the sick.</p>

<p>In almost every detailed account by contemporary
writers these characteristics are noted. And, although
not all who were stricken with the disease manifested it in
this special form, it is clear that, not only were many, and
indeed vast numbers, carried off by rapid corruption of the
lungs and blood-spitting, without any signs of swellings or
carbuncles, but also that the disease was at the time
regarded as most deadly and fatal in this special form.
"From the carbuncles and glandular swellings," says a
contemporary writer, "many recovered; from the
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p008"></a>[p008]</span> blood-spitting none."<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Matteo Villani, one of the most exact
writers about this plague at Florence, says that the sick
"who began to vomit blood quickly died;"<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> whilst Gui
de Chauliac, the Pope's physician at Avignon, who watched
the course of the disease there and left the most valuable
medical account of his observations, says that the epidemic
was of two kinds. The first was marked by "constant
fever and blood-spitting, and from this the patient died in
three days;" the second was the well-known and less
fatal bubonic plague.</p>

<p>The characteristic symptoms of this epidemic, noted in
numerous contemporary accounts, appear to be identical
with those of the disease known as malignant pustule of
the lung; and it would appear probable that this outbreak
of the plague must be distinguished from every other of
which there is any record. "I express my profound conviction,"
writes an eminent French physician, "that the
Black Death stands apart from all those which preceded or
followed it. It ought to be classed among the great and
new popular maladies."<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Be that as it may, the disease, as will be subsequently
seen in the accounts of those who lived at the time, showed
itself in various ways. Some were struck suddenly, and
died within a few hours; others fell into a deep sleep, from
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p009"></a>[p009]</span> which they could not be roused; whilst others, again, were
racked with a sleepless fever, and tormented with a burning
thirst. The usual course of the sickness, when it first
made its appearance, was from three to five days; but
towards the close of the epidemic the recovery of those
suffering from the carbuncular swellings was extended, as
in the case of ordinary Eastern plague, over many months.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Such is a brief account of the disease which devastated
the world in the middle of the fourteenth century. Before
following the course of the epidemic in Italy, to which it
was conveyed, as De' Mussi relates, from the Crimea, some
account of its ravages in Constantinople and in Sicily may
be given. From the Crimea Constantinople lay upon the
highway to the west. Italian ships crossing the Black Sea
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p010"></a>[p010]</span> would naturally touch at this city, then the great centre of
communication between the Eastern and Western Worlds.
From the relation of De' Mussi it appears that Caffa, the
plague-stricken Genoese city in the Crimea, besieged by
the Tartars, was in communication by ship with countries
from which it received supplies. To Constantinople, therefore,
it seems not unlikely that the dreaded disease was
conveyed by a ship coming from this plague centre in the
Crimea. An account of the pestilence at the Imperial city
has come from the pen of the Emperor John Cantacuzene,
who was an eye-witness of what he reports. And although
he adopted the language of Thucydides, about the plague
of Athens, to describe his own experiences at Constantinople,
he could hardly have done so had the description
not been fairly faithful to the reality. "The epidemic which
then (1347) raged in northern Scythia," he writes, "traversed
almost the entire sea-coasts, whence it was carried
over the world. For it invaded not only Pontus, Thrace,
and Macedonia, but Greece, Italy, the Islands, Egypt,
Lybia, Judea, Syria, and almost the entire universe."</p>

<p>The disease according to his account was incurable.
Neither regularity of life nor bodily strength was any
preservation against it. The strong and the weak were
equally struck down; and death spared not those of whom
care was taken, any more than the poor, destitute
of all help. No other illness of any sort showed
itself in this year; all sickness took the form of the
prevalent disease. Medical science recognised that it
was powerless before the foe. The course of the
malady was not in all cases the same. Some people died
suddenly, others during the course of a day, and some after
but an hour's suffering. In the case of those who lingered
for two or three days the attack commenced with a violent
fever. Soon the poison mounted to the brain, and the
sufferer lost the use of speech, became insensible to what
was taking place about him, and appeared sunk in a deep
sleep. If by chance he came to himself and tried to speak
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p011"></a>[p011]</span> his tongue refused to move, and only a few inarticulate
sounds could be uttered, as the nerves had been paralysed;
then he died suddenly.</p>

<p>Others who fell sick under the disease were attacked
first, not in the head, but in the lungs. The organs of
respiration became quickly inflamed, sharp pains were experienced
in the chest, blood was vomited, and the breath
became fetid. The throat and tongue, burnt up by the
excessive fever, became black and congested with blood.
"Those who drank copiously experienced no more relief
than those who drank but little."</p>

<p>Then, after describing the terrible sleeplessness and restlessness
of some sufferers, and the plague spots which broke
out over the body in most cases, the Emperor proceeds:—"The
few who recovered had no second attack, or at least
not of a serious nature." Even some of those who manifested
all the symptoms recovered against every expectation.
It is certain that no efficacious remedy has been discovered.
What had been useful to one appeared a real
poison to another. People who nursed the sick took their
malady, and on this account the deaths multiplied to such
an extent that many houses remained deserted, after all
who had lived in them—even the domestic animals—had
been carried off by the plague.</p>

<p>The profound discouragement of the sick was specially
sad to behold. On the first symptoms of the attack men
lost all hope of recovery, and gave themselves up as lost.
This moral prostration quickly made them worse and
accelerated the hour of their death.</p>

<p>It is impossible in words to give an idea of this malady.
All that can be said is that it had nothing in common with
the ills to which man is naturally subject, and that it was a
chastisement sent by God Himself. By this belief many
turned to better things and resolved to change their lives.
I do not speak only of those who were swept away by the
epidemic, but of those also who recovered and endeavoured
to correct their vicious tendencies and devote themselves
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p012"></a>[p012]</span> to the practice of virtue. A large number, too, before
they were attacked distributed their goods to the poor, and
there were none so insensible or hard-hearted when attacked
as not to show a profound sorrow for their faults so as to
appear before the judgment seat of God with the best
chances of salvation.</p>

<p>"Amongst the innumerable victims of the epidemic in
Constantinople must be reckoned Andronicus, the Emperor's
son, who died the third day. This young man was not
only remarkable for his personal appearance, but was
endowed in the highest degree with those qualities which
form the chief adornment of youth; and everything about
him testified that he would have followed nobly in the footsteps
of his ancestors."</p>

<p>From Constantinople the Italian trading ships passed on
towards their own country, everywhere spreading the
terrible contagion. Their destinations were Genoa and
Venice, as De' Mussi relates; but as the same authority
says: "The sailors, as if accompanied by evil spirits, as
soon as they approached the land, were death to those with
whom they mingled." Thus the advent of the plague can be
traced in the ports of the Adriatic in the autumn of 1347,
and there can be little doubt that it was due to the arrival
of ships bound from the East to Venice. Of the islands of
the ocean, and particularly of Sicily, De' Mussi speaks as
having been affected by the ships that were bound from
the Crimea to Genoa. Of the plague in Sicily there exists
a particular account by one who must have been a
contemporary of the events he describes.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> "A most
deadly pestilence," he says, "sprang up over the entire
island. It happened that in the month of October, in
the year of our Lord, 1347, about the beginning of
the month, twelve Genoese ships, flying from the
divine vengeance which our Lord for their sins had sent
upon them, put into the port of Messina, bringing
with them such a sickness clinging to their very bones
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p013"></a>[p013]</span> that, did anyone speak to them, he was directly struck with
a mortal sickness from which there was no escape." After
detailing the terrible symptoms and describing the rapid
spread of the infection, how the mere breath of the strangers
poisoned those who conversed with them, how to touch or
meddle with anything that belonged to them was to contract
the fatal malady, he continues: "Seeing what a calamity
of sudden death had come to them by the arrival of the
Genoese, the people of Messina drove them in all haste
from their city and port. But the sickness remained and a
terrible mortality ensued. The one thought in the mind of
all was how to avoid the infection. The father abandoned
the sick son; magistrates and notaries refused to come and
make the wills of the dying; even the priests to hear their
confessions. The care of those stricken fell to the Friars
Minor, the Dominicans and members of other orders,
whose convents were in consequence soon emptied of their
inhabitants. Corpses were abandoned in empty houses,
and there was none to give them Christian burial. The
houses of the dead were left open and unguarded with
their jewels, money, and valuables; if anyone wished to
enter, there was no one to prevent him. The great pestilence
came so suddenly that there was no time to organise
any measures of protection; from the very beginning the
officials were too few, and soon there were none. The
population deserted the city in crowds; fearing even to stay
in the environs, they camped out in the open air in the
vineyards, whilst some managed to put up at least a
temporary shelter for their families. Others, again, trusting
in the protection of the virgin, blessed Agatha, sought
refuge in Catania, whither the Queen of Sicily had gone,
and where she directed her son, Don Frederick, to join her.
The Messinese, in the month of November, persuaded the
Patriarch<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Archbishop of Catania to allow the relics of the
Saint to be taken to their city, but the people refused to
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p014"></a>[p014]</span> permit them to leave their ancient resting place. Processions
and pilgrimages were organised to beg God's favour.
Still the pestilence raged and with greater fury. Everyone
was in too great a terror to aid his neighbour. Flight
profited nothing, for the sickness, already contracted and
clinging to the fugitives, was only carried wherever they
sought refuge. Of those who fled some fell on the roads
and dragged themselves to die in the fields, the woods, or
the valleys. Those who reached Catania breathed their
last in the hospitals. At the demand of the terrified
populace the Patriarch forbade, under pain of excommunication,
the burial of any of these Messina refugees
within the city, and their bodies were all thrown into deep
pits outside the walls.</p>

<p>"What shall I say more?" adds the historian. "So wicked
and timid were the Catanians that they refused even to
speak to any from Messina, or to have anything to do with
them, but quickly fled at their approach. Had it not been
for secret shelter afforded by some of their fellow citizens,
resident in the town, the unfortunate refugees would have
been left destitute of all human aid." The contagion, however,
was already spread, and the plague soon became rife.
The same scenes were enacted at Catania as before in
Messina. The Patriarch, desiring to provide for the souls
of the people, gave to the priests, even the youngest, all the
faculties he himself possessed, both episcopal and patriarchal,
for absolving sins. "The pestilence raged in the
city from October, 1347, to April, 1348, and the Patriarch
himself, Gerard Otho, of the Order of St. Francis, fell a
victim to his duty, and was one of the last to be
carried off by the disease. Duke John, who had sought
security by avoiding every infected house and person,
died of the disease at the same time. The plague
was spread in the same way from Messina throughout
Sicily; Syracuse, Girgenti, Sciacca, and Trapani were
successively attacked; in particular it raged in the
district of Trapani, in the extreme west of the island,
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p015"></a>[p015]</span> which," says the writer, "has remained almost without
population."<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Having briefly noticed the origin of the great pestilence
which ravaged Europe in the fourteenth century, and its
progress towards Italy, the story of Gabriel de' Mussi may
again be taken up at the point where he describes the
flight of the Genoese traders from the Crimea. The narrative
has so far anticipated his account only by giving the
history of the epidemic in Constantinople and Sicily.</p>

Sometimes known as S. Feodosia. This port was by the beginning of
the 14th century a most important trading settlement of Genoese merchants.
In 1316 Pope John XXII issued a Bull making it the cathedral city of an extensive
diocese. By the time of the outbreak of the great plague it had become
the centre of almost all commerce between Asia and Europe (<em class="e000I2">Cf.</em> M. G. Canale,

The account of Gabriele de' Mussi, called <em class="e000I2">Ystoria de morbo
seu mortalitate
qui fuit a. 1348</em>, was first printed by Henschel, in Haeser's <em class="e000I2">Archiv für
gesammte Medicin</em> (Jena) ii, 26–59. The editor claims that De' Mussi
was actually present at Caffa during the Tartar siege, and came to Europe in
the plague-stricken ships which conveyed the infection to Italy. Signor Tononi,
who in 1884 reprinted the <em class="e000I2">Ystoria</em> in the <em class="e000I2">Giornale Ligustico</em> (Genoa) vol. x
(1883), p. 139 <em class="e000I2">seqq.</em>, has proved by the acts of the notaries of Piacenza that De'
Mussi never quitted the city at this time, and his realistic narrative must have
been consequently derived from the accounts of others. From the same source
Tononi has shown that De' Mussi acted as notary between <em class="e0U003">A.D.</em> 1300 and
1356, and was consequently born probably somewhere about 1280. He died in
the first half of the year 1356.</p></div>

According to a well-recognized law new epidemics are always most
violent and fatal. The depopulation of the Fiji Islands by the
measles is an instance of the way in which a comparatively mild
disease may in its first attack upon a people prove terribly
destructive. It is commonly thought that it has been the action of
some new disease whereby the races which built the great prehistoric
cities of Africa and America have been completely swept away.</p></div>

The following account of an outbreak of disease
somewhat similar to the "Black Death" appeared in the <em class="e000I2">British
Medical Journal</em> of 5 November, 1892:—"An official report of the
Governor-General of Turkestan, which has recently been published in
St. Petersburg, states that that province has been severely visited
by an epidemic of 'Black Death,' which followed upon the footsteps
of cholera. On September 10 (22) it appeared suddenly at Askabad,
and in six days it killed 1,303 persons in a population of 30,000.
'Black Death' has long been known in Western Asia as a scourge more
deadly than the cholera or the plague. It comes suddenly, sweeping
over a whole district like a pestilential simoon, striking down
animals as well as men, and vanishes as suddenly as it came, before
there is time to ascertain its nature or its mode of diffusion. The
visit here referred to was no exception to this rule. After raging
in Askabad for six days the epidemic ceased, leaving no trace of its
presence but the corpses of its victims. These putrified so rapidly
that no proper post-mortem could be made. The Governor-General gives
some details as to the symptoms and course of the disease, which,
though interesting as far as they go, do not throw much light on
its pathology. The attack begins with rigors of intense severity,
the patient shivering literally from head to foot; the rigors occur
every five minutes for about an hour. Next an unendurable feeling of
heat is complained of; the arteries become tense, and the pulse more
and more rapid, while the temperature steadily rises. Unfortunately
no thermometric readings or other precise data are given. Neither
diarrhœa nor vomiting has been observed. Convulsions alternate
with syncopal attacks, and the patients suffer intense pain. Suddenly
the extremities become stiff and cold, and in from 10 to 20 minutes
the patient sinks into a comatose condition, which speedily ends in
death. Immediately after he has ceased to breathe large black bullæ
form on the body, and quickly spread over its surface. Decomposition
takes place in a few minutes."</p></div>

<a id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.
<span class="smaller">THE EPIDEMIC IN ITALY.</span></h2>

<p class="chap-first">The great sickness reached Italy in the early days of 1348.
The report at Avignon at the time was that three plague-stricken
vessels had put into the port of Genoa in January,
whilst from another source it would appear that at the same
time another ship brought the contagion from the East to
Venice. From these two places the epidemic quickly
spread over the entire country. What happened in the
early days of this frightful scourge is best told in the actual
words of Gabriel de' Mussi, who possessed special means of
knowledge, and who has until quite recently been looked
upon, but incorrectly, as a passenger by one of the very
vessels which brought the plague from the Crimea to
Genoa. The history of the progress of the plague may be
gathered from the pages of the detailed chronicles, which
at that time recorded the principal events in the various
large and prosperous cities of the Italian peninsula, as well
as from the well-known account of the straits to which
Florence was reduced by the sickness, given in the introduction
to the "Decameron" of Boccaccio.</p>

<p>On reviewing in detail the testimonies from every land
relating to this great calamity, it is impossible to overlook
the sameness of the terms in which writers the most diverse
in character, and in places far distant from one another,
describe what passed before their eyes. It has already been
remarked that the imperial historian, John Cantacuzene,
in recounting the horrors of the plague in Constantinople,
has borrowed from Thucydides. But the same ideas, the
very same words, suggest themselves involuntarily to one
and all. The simple monastic annalist of the half-buried
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p017"></a>[p017]</span> cloister in Engelberg, the more courtly chronicler of St.
Denis, the notary who writes with the dryness and technicalities
of his profession, but displays withal a weakness for
rhetoric and gossip, <em class="e000I2">littérateurs</em> like Boccaccio, whose
<em class="e000I2">forte</em> is narrative, or like Petrarch, delighting in a show
of words, the business-like town chronicler of an Italian
city, and the author who aspires to the rank of historian,
the physician whose interest is professional, even the
scribbler who takes this strange theme as the subject for
his jingling verse, all speak with such complete oneness of
expression that it would almost seem that each had copied
his neighbour, and that there is here a fine theme for the
scientific amusement known as "investigation of sources."
It is only when we come to examine the whole body of
evidence that there is borne in upon the mind a realisation
of the nature of a calamity which, spreading everywhere,
was everywhere the same in its horrors, becoming thus
nothing less than a world-wide tragedy, and it is seen that
even the phrases of the rhetorician can do no more than
rise to the terrible reality of fact.</p>

<p>First in importance, as well as in order of time, comes
the testimony of De' Mussi, the substance of which is here
given. It so happened that when the ships left Caffa—some
bound for Genoa, some for Venice, and some to other
parts of the Christian world—a few of the sailors were
already infected by the fatal disease. One sick man was
enough to infect the whole household, and the corpse as
it was carried to the grave brought death to its bearers.
"Tell, O Sicily, and ye, the many islands of the sea, the
judgments of God. Confess, O Genoa, what thou hast
done, since we of Genoa and Venice are compelled to
make God's chastisement manifest. Alas! our ships
enter the port, but of a thousand sailors hardly ten
are spared. We reach our homes; our kindred and our
neighbours come from all parts to visit us. Woe to us for
we cast at them the darts of death! Whilst we spoke to
them, whilst they embraced us and kissed us, we scattered
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p018"></a>[p018]</span> the poison from our lips. Going back to their homes, they
in turn soon infected their whole families, who in three
days succumbed, and were buried in one common grave.
Priests and doctors visiting the sick returned from their
duties ill, and soon were numbered with the dead. O,
death! cruel, bitter, impious death! which thus breaks the
bonds of affection and divides father and mother, brother
and sister, son and wife.</p>

<p>"Lamenting our misery, we feared to fly, yet we dared
not remain." The terror increased when it was found that
even the effects and clothes of the dead were capable of
communicating the disease. This was seen in the case of
four soldiers at a place near Genoa. Returning to their
camp they carried back with them a woollen bed-covering
they had found in a house at Rivarolo, on the sea-coast,
where the sickness had swept away the entire population.
The night following the four slept under the coverlet, and
in the morning all were found to be dead. At Genoa the
plague spared hardly a seventh part of the population. At
Venice it is said that more than seventy died out of every
hundred, and out of four-and-twenty excellent doctors
twenty were soon carried off by the sickness.</p>

<p>"But as an inhabitant I am asked to write more of Piacenza
so that it may be known what happened there in the year
1348. Some Genoese who fled from the plague raging in
their city betook themselves hither. They rested at Bobbio,
and there sold the merchandise they had brought with them.
The purchaser and their host, together with all his family
and many neighbours, were quickly stricken with the sickness
and died. One of these, wishing to make his will,
called a notary, his confessor, and the necessary witnesses.
The next day all these were buried together. So greatly
did the calamity increase that nearly all the inhabitants of
Bobbio soon fell a prey to the sickness, and there remained
in the town only the dead.</p>

<p>"In the spring of 1348 another Genoese infected with the
plague came to Piacenza. He sought out his friend Fulchino
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p019"></a>[p019]</span> della Croce, who took him into his house. Almost immediately
afterwards he died, and the said Fulchino was also
quickly carried off with his entire family and many of his
neighbours. In a brief space the plague was rife throughout
the city. I know not where to begin; everywhere
there was weeping and mourning. So great was the
mortality that men hardly dared to breathe. The dead
were without number, and those who still lived gave themselves
up as lost, and prepared for the tomb.</p>

<p>"The cemeteries failing, it was necessary to dig trenches
to receive the bodies of the dead. It frequently happened
that a husband and wife, a father and son, a mother and
daughter—nay, whole families—were cast together in the
same pit.</p>

<p>"It was the same in the neighbouring towns and villages.
One Oberto di Sasso, who had come one day from an
infected place to the church of the Friars Minor to make
his will, called thither a notary, witnesses, and neighbours.
All these, together with others, to the number of more than
sixty, died within a short space of time. Also the religious
man, friar Sifredo de' Bardi, of the convent and order of
Preachers, a man of prudence and great learning, who had
visited our Lord's sepulchre, died with twenty-three other
members of his order and convent. Also the learned and
virtuous friar Bertolin Coxadocha, of Piacenza, of the
order of Minorites, with four-and-twenty members of his
community was carried off. So too of the convent of
Augustinian Hermits—seven; of the Carmelites—seven;
of the Servites of Mary—four, and more than sixty dignitaries
and rectors of churches in the city and district of
Piacenza died. Of nobles, too, many; of young people a
vast number."</p>

<p>De' Mussi then proceeds to give examples of the
scenes daily passing before his eyes in the plague-stricken
cities of northern Italy. The sick man lay languishing
alone in his house and no one came near him. Those most
dear to him, regardless of the ties of kindred or affection,
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p020"></a>[p020]</span> withdrew themselves to a distance; the doctor did not
come to him, and even the priest with fear and trembling
administered the Sacraments of the Church. Men and
women, racked with the consuming fever, pleaded—but
in vain—for a draught of water, and uselessly raved for
someone to watch at their bedside. The father or the
wife would not touch the corpse of child or husband to
prepare it for the grave, or follow it thither. No prayer
was said, nor solemn office sung, nor bell tolled for the
funeral of even the noblest citizen; but by day and
night the corpses were borne to the common plague-pit
without rite or ceremony. The doors of the houses now
desolate and empty remained closed, and no one cared,
nor, indeed, dared to enter.</p>

<p>Such is the picture of the effect of the malady and the
terrible mortality caused by it drawn by one who seems to
have seen its first introduction into Italy, and who certainly
had the best opportunity of early observing its rapid progress.
It might, perhaps, be thought that his description of
the horrors of the infected cities was over-coloured and the
creation of his imagination. But in the details it bears on
the surface the stamp of truth, and in its chief characteristics
it is confirmed by too many independent witnesses
in other parts of Italy, and even in Europe generally, to
leave a doubt that it corresponded to the literal reality.</p>

<p>What happened at Florence is well-known through the
graphic description of Boccaccio. So terrible was the
mortality in that prosperous city that the very outbreak
became for a time known in Europe as the "Pestilence of
Florence." In the spring of the previous year (1347) a
severe famine had been experienced, and some 94,000
people had been in receipt of State relief, whilst about
4,000 are supposed to have perished of starvation in the
city<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and its neighbourhood. The people, enfeebled by
previous hardships, would naturally fall a prey more easily
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p021"></a>[p021]</span> to the poison of the epidemic. In April, 1348, the
dreaded infection began to show itself. "To cure the
malady," writes Boccaccio, "neither medical knowledge nor
the power of drugs was of any avail, whether because the
disease was in its own nature mortal, or that the physicians
(the number of whom—taking quacks and women pretenders
into account—was grown very great) could form
no just idea of the cause, nor consequently ground a true
method of cure; of those attacked few or none escaped,
but they generally died the third day from the first appearance
of the symptoms, without a fever or other form of illness
manifesting itself. The disease was communicated by
the sick to those in health and seemed daily to gain head
and increase in violence, just as fire will do by casting fresh
fuel on it. The contagion was communicated not only by
conversation with those sick, but also by approaching them
too closely, or even by merely handling their clothes or
anything they had previously touched.</p>

<p>"What I am going to relate is certainly marvellous, and,
had I not seen it with my own eyes, and were there not
many witnesses to attest its truth besides myself, I should
not venture to recount it, whatever the credit of persons
who had informed me of it. Such, I say, was the deadly
character of the pestilential matter, that it passed the
infection not only from man to man; but, what is more
wonderful, and has been often proved, anything belonging
to those sick with the disease, if touched by any other
creature, would certainly affect and even kill it in a short
space of time. One instance of this kind I took special
note of, namely, the rags of a poor man just dead having
been thrown into the street, two hogs came by at the
time and began to root amongst them, shaking them
in their jaws. In less than an hour they fell down and
died on the spot.</p>

<p>"Strange were the devices resorted to by the survivors to
secure their safety. Divers as were the means, there was
one feature common to all, selfish and uncharitable as it
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p022"></a>[p022]</span> was—the avoidance of the sick, and of everything that had
been near them; men thought only of themselves.</p>

<p>"Some held it was best to lead a temperate life and to
avoid every excess. These making up parties together,
and shutting themselves up from the rest of the world, ate
and drank moderately of the best, diverting themselves
with music and such other entertainments as they might
have at home, and never listening to news from without
which might make them uneasy. Others maintained that free
living was a better preservative, and would gratify every
passion and appetite. They would drink and revel incessantly
in tavern after tavern, or in those private houses
which, frequently found deserted by the owners, were
therefore open to anyone; but they yet studiously avoided,
with all their irregularity, coming near the infected. And
such at that time was the public distress that the laws,
human and divine, were not regarded, for the officers
to put them in force being either dead, sick, or without
assistants, everyone did just as he pleased."</p>

<p>Another class of people chose a middle course. They
neither restricted themselves to the diet of the former
nor gave way to the intemperance of the latter; but eating
and drinking what their appetites required, they went
about everywhere with scents and nosegays to smell at,
since they looked upon the whole atmosphere as tainted
with the effluvia arising from the dead bodies.</p>

<p>"Others, again, of a more callous disposition declared, as
perhaps the safest course in the extremity, that the only
remedy was in flight. Persuaded, therefore, of this, and
thinking only of themselves, great numbers of men
and women left the city, their goods, their house, and kindred,
and fled into the country parts; as if the wrath of God
had been restricted to a visitation of those only within the
city walls, and hence none should remain in the doomed
place.</p>

<p>"But different as were the courses pursued, the sickness
fell upon all these classes without distinction; neither did
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p023"></a>[p023]</span> all of any class die, nor did all escape; and they who first
set the example of forsaking others now languished themselves
where there was no one to take pity on them. I
pass by the little regard that citizens and distant relations
showed one to the other, for the terror was such that
brother even fled from brother, wife from husband, nay, the
parent from her own child. The sick could obtain help
only from the few who still obeyed the law of charity, or
from hired servants who demanded extravagant wages and
were fit for little else than to hand what was asked for, and
to note when the patient died. Even such paid helpers
were scarce, and their desire of gain frequently cost them
their lives. The rich passed out of this world without
a single person to aid them; few had the tears of friends
at their departure. The corpse was attended to the grave
only by fellows hired for the purpose, who would put the
bier on their shoulders and hurry with it to the nearest
church, where it was consigned to the tomb without any
ceremony whatever, and wherever there was room.</p>

<p>"With regard to the lower classes, and, indeed, in the case
of many of the middle rank of life, the scenes enacted were
sadder still. They fell sick by thousands, and, having no
one whatever to attend them, most of them died. Some
breathed their last in the streets, others shut up in their
own houses, when the effluvia which came from their
corpses was the first intimation of their deaths. An arrangement
was now made for the neighbours, assisted by
such bearers as they could get, to clear the houses, and
every morning to lay the bodies of the dead at their doors.
Thence the corpses were carried to the grave on a bier, two
or three at a time. There was no one to follow, none to
shed tears, for things had come to such a pass that men's
lives were no more thought of than those of beasts. Even
friends would laugh and make themselves merry, and
women had learned to consider their own lives before
everything else.</p>

<p>"Consecrated ground no longer sufficed, and it became
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p024"></a>[p024]</span> necessary to dig trenches, into which the bodies were put
by hundreds, laid in rows as goods packed in a ship; a little
earth was cast upon each successive layer until the pits
were filled to the top. The adjacent country presented the
same picture as the city; the poor distressed labourers and
their families, without physicians, and without help,
languished on the highways, in the fields, in their own
cottages, dying like cattle rather than human beings. The
country people, like the citizens, grew dissolute in their
manners and careless of everything. They supposed that
each day might be their last; and they took no care nor
thought how to improve their substance, or even to utilise
it for present support. The flocks and herds, when driven
from their homes, would wander unwatched through the
forsaken harvest fields, and were left to return of their
own accord, if they would, at the approach of night."</p>

<p>Between March and the July following it was estimated
that upwards of a hundred thousand souls had
perished in the city alone.</p>

<p>"What magnificent dwellings," the writer continues,
"what stately palaces, were then rendered desolate, even to
the last inhabitant! How many noble families became
extinct! What riches, what vast possessions were left
with no known heir to inherit them! What numbers of
both sexes, in the prime and vigour of youth, whom in the
morning Galen, Hippocrates, or Æsculapius himself, would
have declared in perfect health, after dining heartily with
their friends here, have supped with their departed friends
in another world."<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>It might perhaps be suspected that this description of
Boccaccio as to the terrible nature of the plague in Florence
was either a fancy picture of his imagination or intended
merely as a rhetorical introduction to the tales told in the
"Decameron," with only a slender foundation of fact.
Unfortunately other authorities are forthcoming to confirm
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p025"></a>[p025]</span> the graphic relation of the Florentine poet in all its details.
Amongst others who were carried off by the pestilence in
Florence was the renowned historian, Giovanni Villani. His
work was taken up by his brother Matteo, who commences
his annals with an account of the epidemic. So terrible
did the destruction of human life appear to him that he tells
his readers that no greater catastrophe had fallen on the
world since the universal Deluge. According to his testimony,
it involved the whole of the Italian peninsula, with
the exception of Milan and some Alpine districts of
northern Lombardy. In each place visited by the scourge
it lasted five months, and everywhere Christian parents
abandoned their children and kinsfolk, in as callous a way
as "might perhaps be expected from infidels and savages."
As regards Florence, whilst some few devoted themselves
to the care of the sick, many fled from the plague-stricken
city. The epidemic raged there from April till September,
1348, and it is the opinion of Villani that three out of every
five persons in the city and neighbourhood fell victims to
it. As to the effect of the scourge on the survivors, the
historian records that whilst it would naturally have
been expected that men, impressed by so terrible a chastisement,
would have become better, the very contrary was the
fact. Work, too, was given over, and "men gave themselves
up to the enjoyment of the worldly riches to which
they had succeeded." Idleness, dissolute morals, sins of
gluttony, banquets, revels in taverns, unbridled luxury,
fickleness in dress and constant changes according to
whim, such were the characteristic marks of the well-to-do
Italian citizens when the plague had passed. And
the poor, also, Villani states, became idle and unwilling
to work, considering that when so many had been carried
off by the pestilence there could not but be an abundance
for those whom Providence had spared.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p026"></a>[p026]</span></p>

<p>The same story is told in all the contemporary chronicles
of Italian cities. At Pisa the terrible mortality lasted till
September, 1348, and there were few families that did not
reckon two or three of their members among the dead.
Many names are said to have been completely wiped off
from the roll of the living. At least a hundred each week
were carried to the grave in the city, whilst those who had
been bold enough to watch at the death-bed of a relation
or friend appealed in vain to passers-by to aid them to
bury the corpse. "Help us to bear this body to the pit,"
they cried, "so that we in our turn may deserve to find
some to carry us." The awful suddenness of the death
often inflicted by the scourge is noted by the author
of the "Chronicle of Pisa," in common with nearly every
writer of this period. Men who in the morning were
apparently well had before evening been carried to the
grave.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>A Paduan chronicler, writing at the time, notes that one
sick man as a rule infected the house in which he lay, so
that once the sickness entered into a dwelling all were
seized by it, "even the animals." To Padua a stranger
brought the sickness, and in a brief space the whole city
was suffering from it. Hardly a third of the population
was left after the scourge had passed.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> At Siena, according
to Di Tura, a contemporary chronicler, the plague
commenced in April and lasted till October, 1348. All
who could fled from the stricken city. In May, July, and
August so many died that neither position nor money
availed to procure porters to carry the dead to the public
pits. "And I, Agniolo di Tura," writes this author,
"carried with my own hands my five little sons to the pit;
and what I did many others did likewise." All expected
death, and people generally said, and believed, that the end
of the world had certainly come. In Siena and its
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p027"></a>[p027]</span> neighbourhood, according to Di Tura, about 80,000 people were
thought to have died in these seven months.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>At Orvieto the plague began in May. Some 500 died in
a very short space of time, many of them suddenly; the
shops remained closed, and business and work was at a
standstill. Here it ran its usual five months' course, and
finished in September, when many families were found to
have become extinct.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> At Rimini it was noticed that the
poor were the first to be attacked and the chief sufferers.
The sickness first showed itself on May 15th, 1348, and
only died out in the following December, when, according
to the computation of the chronicler, two out of three of
the inhabitants had been swept away.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>An anonymous contemporary Italian writer describes the
sickness as a "swift and sharp fever, with blood-spitting,
carbuncle or fistula." Only the few, he says, recovered when
once stricken with the disease. The sick visibly infected
with their corruption the healthy, even by talking with
them; for from this mere conversing with the sick an infinite
number of men and women died and are buried. "And
here," says the writer, "I can give my testimony. A certain
man bled me, and the blood flowing touched his face. On
that same day he was taken ill, and the next he died; and
by the mercy of God I have escaped. I note this because,
as by mere communication with the sick the plague infected
mortally the healthy, the father afterwards avoided his
stricken son, the brother his brother, the wife her husband,
and so in each case the man in health studiously avoided
the sick. Priests and doctors even fled in fear from those
ill, and all avoided the dead. In many places and houses
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p028"></a>[p028]</span> when an inmate died the rest quickly, one after another,
expired. And so great was the overwhelming number of
the dead that it was necessary to open new cemeteries in
every place. In Venice there were almost 100,000 dead,
and so great was the multitude of corpses everywhere that
few attended any funeral or dirge.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. This pestilence
did not cease in the land from February till the feast of All
Saints (November 1st, 1348), and the offices of the dead
were chanted only by the voices of boys; which boys,
without learning, and by rote only, sang the office walking
through the streets." The writer then notices the general
dissoluteness which ensued after the disease, and its effect
in lowering the standard of probity and morals.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>To the terrible accounts given by De' Mussi of the state
of plague-stricken Genoa and Piacenza, and that of
Boccaccio, of the ravages of the pestilence in the city of
Florence, may be well added the eloquent letters of the
poet Petrarch, in which he laments the overwhelming
catastrophe, as he experienced it in the town of Parma.
Here, as in so many other places, the inhabitants vainly
endeavoured to prevent the entry of the disease by forbidding
all intercourse with the suffering cities of Florence,
Venice, Genoa and Pisa. The measures taken to isolate
Parma appear to have been, at least, for a time, successful,
as the dreaded plague apparently did not make its appearance
till the beginning of June, 1348.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> But in the
six months during which it lasted it desolated the entire
neighbourhood. In Parma and Reggio many thousands, estimated
roundly at 40,000, were carried off by it.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Petrarch
was at this period a canon of the cathedral of Parma,
and had made the acquaintance at Avignon of Laura, who
quickly became the object of his admiration as a typical
Christian mother of a family, and as a fitting subject to
inspire his poetic muse. Laura died at Avignon, one of the
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p029"></a>[p029]</span> many who fell victims to the great pestilence which was
then raging in that city. The letter written by a friend
named Louis to inform Petrarch of this death found him at
Parma on May 19th, 1348.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> A month later the poet wrote
to Avignon in the most heart-broken language to his
brother, a religious at Monrieux, and the only survivor of a
convent of five-and-thirty.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> "My brother! my brother!
my brother," he wrote. "A new beginning to a letter,
though used by Marcus Tullius fourteen hundred years ago.
Alas! my beloved brother, what shall I say? How shall I
begin? Whither shall I turn? On all sides is sorrow;
everywhere is fear. I would, my brother, that I had never
been born, or, at least, had died before these times. How
will posterity believe that there has been a time when
without the lightnings of heaven or the fires of earth,
without wars or other visible slaughter, not this or that
part of the earth, but well-nigh the whole globe, has
remained without inhabitants.</p>

<p>"When has any such thing been ever heard or seen; in
what annals has it ever been read that houses were left
vacant, cities deserted, the country neglected, the fields too
small for the dead, and a fearful and universal solitude over
the whole earth? Consult your historians, they are silent;
question your doctors, they are dumb; seek an answer
from your philosophers, they shrug their shoulders and
frown, and with their fingers to their lips bid you be
silent.</p>

<p>"Will posterity ever believe these things when we, who
see, can scarcely credit them? We should think we were
dreaming if we did not with our eyes, when we walk
abroad, see the city in mourning with funerals, and returning
to our home, find it empty, and thus know that what we
lament is real.</p>

<p>"Oh, happy people of the future, who have not known
these miseries and perchance will class our testimony with
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p030"></a>[p030]</span> the fables. We have, indeed, deserved these (punishments)
and even greater; but our forefathers also have
deserved them, and may our posterity not also merit the
same."</p>

<p>Then, after saying that the universal misery is enough to
make one think that God has ceased to have a care for His
creatures, and putting this thought aside as blasphemy, the
writer continues: "But whatever the causes and however
hidden, the effects are manifest. To turn from public to
private sorrows; the first part of the second year is passed
since I returned to Italy. I do not ask you to look back
any further; count these few days, and think what we were
and what we are. Where are now our pleasant friends?
Where the loved faces? Where their cheering words?
Where their sweet and gentle conversation? We were
surrounded by a crowd of intimates, now we are almost
alone."</p>

<p>Speaking of one special friend, Paganinus of Milan,
Petrarch writes: "He was suddenly seized in the evening
by the pestilential sickness. After supping with friends
he spent some time in conversation with me, in the enjoyment
of our common friendship and in talking over our
affairs. He passed the night bravely in the last agony,
and in the morning was carried off by a swift death.
And, that no horror should be wanting, in three days his
sons and all his family had followed him to the tomb."<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>In other towns of Italy the same tragedy, as told in the
words of Boccaccio and Petrarch, was being enacted during
the early spring and the summer months of 1348. At Venice,
where the pestilence obtained an early foothold, and the
position of which rendered it particularly susceptible to
infection, the mortality was so great that it was represented
by the round numbers of 100,000 souls.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>Signor Cecchetti's researches into the history of the
medical faculty at Venice at this period furnish many
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p031"></a>[p031]</span> interesting details as to the spread of the sickness.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
Although surgeons were not allowed by law to practise
medicine, so great was the need during the prevalence
of the dread mortality that one surgeon, Andrea di Padova,
was allowed to have saved the lives of more than a
hundred people by his timely assistance.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> In the 14th
century Venice was troubled by the plague some fifteen
times, but that of 1348 was "the great epidemic"—"the
horrible mortality"—to the chroniclers of the time. For a
long period after, public and other documents make it the
excuse for all kinds of irregularities.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> The diplomas of
merit bestowed upon doctors who remained faithful to their
posts by the authorities of Venice speak of death following
upon the first infection within a very short space of time.
So depopulated was the city that it might be said no one
was left in it. Many doctors fled, others shut themselves
in their houses. Artisans and even youths undertook the
duties of physicians, and helped numbers to recover.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>On Sunday, March 30th, 1348, the Great Council of
Venice chose a commission of three to watch over the public
safety. These a few days later ordered deep pits to be
made in one of the islands to receive the bodies of those
who died in the hospitals and of the poor, and to convey
them thither, ships were appointed to be always in waiting.</p>

<p>The rich fled from the place; officials could not be found,
and the Great Council was so reduced that the legal number
for transacting business could not be got together. Notaries
died in great numbers, and the prisons were thrown open.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
When the epidemic had ceased the Senate had great
difficulty in finding three doctors for the city. On
January 12th, 1349, Marco Leon, a capable physician, and
a native of Venice, who was in practice at Perugia, offered
to return to his own city "since," as he says, "it has
pleased God by the terrible mortality to leave our native
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p032"></a>[p032]</span> place so destitute of upright and capable doctors that it
may be said not one has been left."<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>Details of a similar nature might be multiplied from the
contemporary Italian records. What has been here given,
however, will enable the reader to form some estimate
of the nature of the terrible disease and of the extent
of the universal devastation of the Italian peninsula.
The annals relate that in every city, castle, and town
death and desolation reigned supreme. In most
places, as in Pisa, for example, law and order became
things of the past; the administration of justice was
impossible; criminals of every kind did what they best
pleased,<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> and for a considerable time after the plague had
passed the Courts of Law were occupied in disputes over
the possessions of the dead. When the wave of pestilence
had rolled on to other lands there came in its wake famine
and general distress in Italy, but strangely accompanied
with the lavish expenditure of those who considered that,
where so many had died, there should be enough and to
spare of worldly goods for such as were left. The land lay
uncultivated and the harvest was unreaped. Provisions and
other necessaries of life became dear. Markets ceased to be
held, and cities and towns devoid of inhabitants were
spectacles of decay and desolation. It is said, and there
does not appear to be reason to doubt the statement, in
view of the many contemporary accounts of the disaster,
that at least one half of the general population of Italy were
swept away by the scourge. This relation of the horrors
of the year 1348 in Italy may be closed by the account
left us of some students from Bohemia, who at this time
journeyed back to their country from Bologna.</p>

<p>"At this time," says a chronicle of Prague, "some
students, coming from Bologna into Bohemia, saw that in
most of the cities and castles they passed through few remained
alive, and in some all were dead. In many houses
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p033"></a>[p033]</span> also those who had escaped with their lives were so
weakened by the sickness that one could not give another
a draught of water, nor help him in any way, and so passed
their time in great affliction and distress. Priests, too,
ministering the sacraments, and doctors medicines, to the
sick were infected by them and died, and so many passed
out of this life without confession or the sacraments of the
Church, as the priests were dead. There were generally
made great, broad and deep pits in which the bodies of the
dead were buried. In many places, too, the air was more
infected and more deadly than poisoned food, from the
corruption of the corpses, since there was no one left to
bury them. Of the foresaid students, moreover, only one
returned to Bohemia, and his companions all died on the
journey."<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<h2 title="Chapter III. Progress of the Plague in France.">
<a id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.
<span class="smaller">PROGRESS OF THE PLAGUE IN FRANCE.</span></h2>

<p class="chap-first">Almost simultaneously with the outbreak of the pestilence
in Italy it obtained a foothold in the South of France.
According to a contemporary account, written at Avignon
in 1348, the disease was brought into Marseilles by one of
the three Genoese ships, which had been compelled to
leave the port of Genoa when the inhabitants discovered
that by their means the dreaded plague had already commenced
its ravages in their city. It would consequently
appear most likely that the mortality began in Marseilles
somewhere about the first days of January, 1348, although
one account places the commencement of the sickness as
early as All Saints' Day (November 1), 1347.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> The number
of deaths in this great southern port of France fully equalled
that of the populous cities of Italy. In a month the sickness
is said to have carried off 57,000 of the inhabitants of
Marseilles and its neighbourhood.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> One chronicle says
that "the Bishop, with the entire chapter of the cathedral,
and nearly all the friars, Preachers and Minorites, together
with two-thirds of the inhabitants, perished" at this time;
and adds that upon the sea might be seen ships, laden with
merchandise, driven about hither and thither by the waves,
the steersman and every sailor having been carried off by
the disease.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Another, speaking of Marseilles after the
pestilence had passed, says that "so many died that it
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p035"></a>[p035]</span> remained like an uninhabited place."<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> It is of interest to
record that amongst the survivors there was an English
doctor, William Grisant, of Merton College, Oxford. He
had studied medicine at the then celebrated school of
Montpellier, and was in practice at Marseilles during the
visitation of the great plague of 1348, dying two years
later, in 1350.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>At Montpellier the ravages were, if possible, even greater.
Of the twelve magistrates, or consuls, ten died, and in the
numerous monasteries scarcely one religious was spared.
The Dominicans here were very numerous, numbering
some 140 members, and of these seven only are said to
have been left alive.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Simon de Covino, a doctor, of Paris,
who probably witnessed the course of the disease at Montpellier,
wrote an account of his experiences in a poetical
form in 1350. The moral of his verse is the same as Boccaccio's,
and the chief interest lies in the fact that, like the
Italian poet, Covino was an eye-witness of what he relates,
whilst his medical training makes his testimony as to the
chief characteristics of the disease specially important.
The name he gives to the malady is the <em class="e000I2">pestis inguinaria</em>,
or bubonic plague of the East. He describes a burning
pain, beginning under the arms, or in the groin, and extending
to the regions of the heart. A mortal fever then
spread to the vital parts; the heart, lungs, and breathing
passages were chiefly affected, the strength fell quickly,
and the person so stricken was unable to fight any length
of time against the poison.</p>

<p>One very singular effect of the disease is noted by the
author:—"The pestilence," he asserts, "stamped itself upon
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p036"></a>[p036]</span> the entire population. Faces became pale, and the doom
which threatened the people was marked upon their foreheads.
It was only necessary to look into the countenances
of men and women to read there recorded the blow which
was about to fall; a marked pallor announced the approach
of the enemy, and before the fatal day the sentence of
death was written unmistakably on the face of the victims.
No climate appeared to have any effect upon the strange
malady. It appeared to be stayed neither by heat nor cold.
High and healthy situations were as much subject to it as
damp and low places. It spread during the colder season
of winter as rapidly as in the heat of the summer months."</p>

<p>About the contagious nature of the epidemic there
could be no doubt. "It has been proved," wrote Covino,
"that when it once entered a house scarcely one
of those who dwelt in it escaped." The contagion
was so great that one sick person, so to speak, would
"infect the whole world." "A touch, even a breath, was
sufficient to transmit the malady." Those who were obliged
to render ordinary assistance to the sick fell victims. "It
happened also that priests, those sacred physicians of souls,
were seized by the plague whilst administering spiritual
aid; and often by a single touch, or a single breath of the
plague-stricken, they perished even before the sick person
they had come to assist." Clothes were justly regarded as
infected, and even the furniture of houses attacked was
suspected. At Montpellier, at the time of the visitation,
the writer says there were more doctors than elsewhere,
but hardly one escaped the infection, and this even although
it was recognised that medical skill was of little or no
avail.</p>

<p>According to the experience of this Montpellier doctor
the mortality was greatest among the poor, because their
hard lives and their poverty rendered them more susceptible
to the deadly infection, and their condition did not
enable them to combat it with the chances of success
possessed by the well-to-do classes. As to the extent of
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p037"></a>[p037]</span> the mortality, he says "that the number of those swept
away was greater than those left alive; cities are now
(<em class="e000I2">i.e.</em>, 1350) depopulated, thousands of houses are locked up,
thousands stand with their doors wide open, their owners
and those who dwelt in them having been swept away."
Lastly, this writer bears testimony to the baneful effect
the scourge had upon the morals of those who had been
spared. Such visitations, he thinks, must always exercise
the most lowering influence upon the general virtue of the
world.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>From Marseilles the epidemic quickly spread northwards
up the Rhone valley, and in a westerly direction through
Languedoc. Montpellier, too, quickly passed on the
infection. It commenced at Narbonne in the first week
of Lent, 1348, and is said to have carried off 30,000 of
the inhabitants. Indeed, so fearful was the visitation,
that this ancient city is reported never to have recovered
from the desolation it caused.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>At Arles, which was attacked very shortly after the
disease had gained a footing on French soil, most of the
inhabitants perished.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> It reached Avignon as early as
January, 1348. In this city Pope Clement VI., then in the
sixth year of his pontificate, held his court. Before the
arrival of the dreaded visitant was publicly recognised
sixty-six religious of the convent of Carmelites had been
carried off, and in the first three days 1,800 people are
reported to have died. In the seven months during which
the scourge lasted the vast roll of the dead in the territory
of Avignon had mounted up to 150,000 persons, amongst
whom was the friend of Petrarch, Laura de Noves, who
died on Good Friday, March 27th, 1348.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Even in
England at the time the excessive mortality at Avignon
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p038"></a>[p038]</span> was noted and remarked upon.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Great numbers of
Jews are said to have been carried off because of the
unsanitary conditions in which they lived, and an equally
great number of Spaniards resident in the city, whose
propensity for good living rendered them most susceptible
to the infection.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>The alarming mortality quickly caused a panic. "For
such terror," writes an author of the lives of the Popes at
Avignon, "took possession of nearly everyone, that as
soon as the ulcer or boil appeared on anyone he was
deserted by all, no matter how nearly they might be
related to him. For the father left his son, the son his
father, on his sick bed. In any house when a person
became sick with the infirmity and died it generally
happened that all others there were attacked and quickly
followed him to the grave; yea, even the animals in the
place, such as dogs, cats, cocks, and hens also died.
Hence those who had strength fled for fear of what had
taken place, and, as a consequence, many who might
otherwise have recovered perished through want of care.
Many, too, who were seized with the sickness, being
considered certain to die and without any hope of recovery,
were carried off at once to the pit and buried. And in this
way many were buried alive."</p>

<p>The same writer notices the charity of the Pope
at this terrible time, in causing doctors to visit and assist
the sick poor. "And since the ordinary cemeteries did
not suffice to hold the bodies of the dead, the Pope
purchased a large field and caused it to be consecrated as
a cemetery where anyone might be buried. And here an
infinite number of people were then interred."<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p039"></a>[p039]</span></p>

<p>The most important and particular account of the
pestilence at Avignon, however, is that of a certain Canon
of the Low Countries, who wrote at the time from the city
to his friends in Bruges. He was in the train of a Cardinal
on a visit to the Roman Curia when the plague broke out.
"The disease," he writes, "is threefold in its infection;
that is to say, firstly, men suffer in their lungs and breathing,
and whoever have these corrupted, or even slightly
attacked, cannot by any means escape nor live beyond two
days. Examinations have been made by doctors in many
cities of Italy, and also in Avignon, by order of the Pope,
in order to discover the origin of this disease. Many dead
bodies have been thus opened and dissected, and it is found
that all who have died thus suddenly have had their lungs
infected and have spat blood. The contagious nature of
the disease is indeed the most terrible of all the terrors
(of the time), for when anyone who is infected by it dies,
all who see him in his sickness, or visit him, or do any
business with him, or even carry him to the grave, quickly
follow him thither, and there is no known means of protection.</p>

<p>"There is another form of the sickness, however, at
present running its course concurrently with the first;
that is, certain aposthumes appear under both arms, and
by these also people quickly die. A third form of the
disease—like the two former, running its course at this
same time with them—is that from which people of both
sexes suffer from aposthumes in the groin. This, likewise,
is quickly fatal. The sickness has already grown to such
proportions that, from fear of contagion, no doctor will
visit a sick man, even if the invalid would gladly give him
everything he possessed; neither does a father visit his
son, nor a mother her daughter, nor a brother his brother,
nor a son his father, nor a friend his friend, nor an
acquaintance his acquaintance, nor, in fact, does anyone
go to another, no matter how closely he may be allied to
him by blood, unless he is prepared to die with him or
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p040"></a>[p040]</span> quickly to follow after him. Still, a large number of persons
have died merely through their affection for others;
for they might have escaped had they not, moved by piety
and Christian charity, visited the sick at the time.</p>

<p>"To put the matter shortly, one-half, or more than a half,
of the people at Avignon are already dead. Within the
walls of the city there are now more than 7,000 houses
shut up; in these no one is living, and all who have
inhabited them are departed; the suburbs hardly contain
any people at all. A field near 'Our Lady of Miracles'
has been bought by the Pope and consecrated as a
cemetery. In this, from the 13th of March,<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> 11,000
corpses have been buried. This number does not include
those interred in the cemetery of the hospital of St. Anthony,
in cemeteries belonging to the religious bodies, and in the
many others which exist in Avignon. Nor must I be silent
about the neighbouring parts, for at Marseilles all the gates
of the city, with the exception of two small ones, are now
closed, for there four-fifths of the inhabitants are dead.</p>

<p>"The like account I can give of all the cities and towns
of Provence. Already the sickness has crossed the Rhone,
and ravaged many cities and villages as far as Toulouse,
and it ever increases in violence as it proceeds. On account
of this great mortality there is such a fear of death that
people do not dare even to speak with anyone whose
relative has died, because it is frequently remarked that in
a family where one dies nearly all the relations follow him,
and this is commonly believed among the people. Neither
are the sick now served by their kindred, except as dogs
would be; food is put near the bed for them to eat and
drink, and then those still in health fly and leave the house.
When a man dies some rough countrymen, called <em class="e000I2">gavoti</em>,
come to the house, and, after receiving a sufficiently large
reward, carry the corpse to the grave. Neither relatives nor
friends go to the sick, nor do priests even hear their
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p041"></a>[p041]</span> confessions nor give them the Sacraments; but everyone whilst
still in health looks after himself. It daily happens that
some rich man dying is borne to the grave by these ruffians
without lights, and without a soul to follow him, except
these hired mourners. When a corpse is carried by all fly
through the streets and get into their houses. Nor do these
said wretched <em class="e000I2">gavoti</em>, strong as they are, escape; but
most of them after a time become infected by this contagion
and die. All the poor who were wont to receive bread
from the rich are dead; that is to say, briefly, where daily
in ordinary times there were distributed sixty-four measures
of wheat for bread, fifty loaves being made from each
measure, now only one measure is given away, and sometimes
even a half is found to be sufficient.</p>

<p>"And it is said that altogether in three months—that is
from January 25th to the present day (April 27th)—62,000
bodies have been buried in Avignon. The Pope, however,
about the middle of March last past, after mature deliberation,
gave plenary absolution till Easter, as far as the
keys of the Church extended, to all those who, having
confessed and being contrite, should happen to die of the
sickness. He ordered likewise devout processions, singing
the Litanies, to be made on certain days each week, and to
these, it is said, people sometimes come from the neighbouring
districts to the number of 2,000; amongst them many of
both sexes are barefooted, some are in sackcloth, some with
ashes, walking with tears and tearing their hair, and beating
themselves with scourges even to the drawing of blood.
The Pope was personally present at some of these processions,
but they were then within the precincts of his
palace. What will be the end, or whence all this has had
its beginning, God alone knows.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>

<p>"Some wretched men have been caught with certain
dust, and, whether justly or unjustly God only knows,
they are accused of having poisoned the water, and men in
fear do not drink the water from wells; for this many have
been burnt and daily are burnt.
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p042"></a>[p042]</span></p>

<p>"Fish, even sea fish, is commonly not eaten, as people
say they have been infected by the bad air. Moreover,
people do not eat, nor even touch spices, which have not
been kept a year, since they fear they may have lately
arrived in the aforesaid ships. And, indeed, it has many
times been observed that those who have eaten these new
spices and even some kinds of sea fish have suddenly been
taken ill.</p>

<p>"I write this to you, my friends, that you may know the
dangers in which we live. And if you desire to preserve
yourselves, the best advice is to eat and drink temperately,
to avoid cold, not to commit excess of any kind, and, above
all, to converse little with others, at this time especially,
except with the few whose breath is sweet. But it is best to
remain at home until this epidemic has passed.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>

<p>"Know, also, that the Pope has lately left Avignon, as is
reported, and has gone to the castle called Stella, near
Valence on the Rhone, two leagues off, to remain there till
times change. The Curia, however, preferred to remain at
Avignon, (but) vacations have been proclaimed till the feast
of St. Michael. All the auditors, advocates, and procurators
have either left, intend to leave immediately, or
are dead. I am in the hands of God, to whom I commend
myself. My master will follow the Pope, so they say, and
I with him, for there are some castles near the airy
mountains where the mortality has not yet appeared, and
it is thought that the best chance is there. To choose and
to do what is best may the Omnipotent and merciful God
grant us all. Amen."<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>From another source some corroboration of the mortality,
described by the writer of this letter, can be obtained.
The 11,000, stated by the anonymous canon to have been
buried in the Pope's new cemetery from March 13th to
April 27th may appear excessive; still more, the 62,000
reported to have died in the three months between the
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p043"></a>[p043]</span> first outbreak, on January 25th, and the date when the
letter was written. The statements of the writer are, however,
so circumstantial and given with such detail, that, allowing
for the tendency in all such catastrophes to exaggerate
rather than minimise the number of the victims, it is
probable that his estimate of the terrible destruction of life
at Avignon and in the neighbourhood is substantially
accurate. Writing, as he does, on the Sunday after Easter,
1348, he evidently points to the time of Lent as the period
during which the epidemic was at its height. This is borne
out by a statement in a German chronicle, which says: "In
Venice, in the whole of Italy and Provence, especially in
cities on the sea-coast, there died countless numbers. And
at Avignon, where the Roman Curia then was, in the first
three days after mid-Lent Sunday, 1,400 people were computed
to have been buried."<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Mid-Lent Sunday, in 1348,
fell upon March 30th, and, consequently, according to this
authority, on the last day of March and the first two days
of April the death-rate was over 450 a day.</p>

<p>No account of the plague at Avignon would be complete
without some notice of Gui de Chauliac, and some quotations
from the work he has left to posterity upon this particular
outbreak. De Chauliac was the medical attendant
of Pope Clement VI. He devoted himself to the service
of the sick during the time of the epidemic, and, although
he himself caught the infection, his life was happily spared
to the service of others, and to enable him to write an
account of the sickness. The mortality, he says, commenced
in the month of January, 1348, and lasted for the
space of seven months. "It was of two kinds; the first
lasted two months, with constant fever and blood-spitting,
and of this people died in three days.</p>

<p>"The second lasted for the rest of the time. In this,
together with constant fever, there were external carbuncles,
or buboes, under the arm or in the groin, and the
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p044"></a>[p044]</span> disease ran its course in five days. The contagion was so
great (especially when there was blood-spitting) that not
only by remaining (with the sick) but even by looking (at
them) people seemed to take it; so much so, that many
died without any to serve them, and were buried without
priests to pray over their graves.</p>

<p>"A father did not visit his son, nor the son his father.
Charity was dead. The mortality was so great that it left
hardly a fourth part of the population. Even the doctors
did not dare to visit the sick from fear of infection, and
when they did visit them they attempted nothing to heal
them, and thus almost all those who were taken ill died,
except towards the end of the epidemic, when some few
recovered."</p>

<p>"As for me, to avoid infamy, I did not dare to absent
myself, but still I was in continual fear." Towards the end
of the sickness de Chauliac took the infection, and was in
great danger for six weeks, but in the end recovered.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>It was according to the advice of this same Gui de
Chauliac that Pope Clement VI. isolated himself and kept
large fires always alight in his apartments, just as Pope
Nicholas IV. had done in a previous epidemic. In the
whole district of Provence the mortality appears to have
been very great. In the Lent of 1348 no fewer than 358
Dominicans are said to have died.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> Even by the close of
the November of this year the terror of the time had
not passed away from Avignon and the Papal Court.
Writing to King Louis of Hungary, on the 23rd of that
month, the Pope excused himself for not having sent
before, "as the deadly plague, which has devastated these
and other parts of the world by an unknown and terrible
mortality, has not only, by God's will, carried off some of
our brethren, but caused others to fly from the Roman
Curia to avoid death."<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p045"></a>[p045]</span></p>

<p>In the early summer of the same year, 1348, just as the
plague was lessening its ravages at Avignon, the Pope
addressed a letter to the General Chapter of the Friars
Minor then being held at Verona. He laments the misery
into which the world has been plunged, chiefly "by the
mortal sickness which is carrying off from us old and
young, rich and poor, in one common, sudden and unforeseen
death." He urges them to unite in prayer that the
plague may cease, and grants special indulgences "to such
among you as, during this Chapter, or whilst returning to
your homes, may chance to die."<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Of these Franciscans
it is said that, in Italy alone, 30,000 died in this
sickness.</p>

<p>From its first entry into France in the early days of
1348, the plague was ever spreading far and wide. The
letter from Avignon, already given, speaks of the ravages
of the mortality in the whole of Provence, and of its
having, before the end of April, reached Toulouse on its
journey westward. In the August of this year (1348)
Bordeaux was apparently suffering from it, since in that
month the Princess Joan, daughter of Edward III., who was
on her way to be married to Pedro, son of the King of
Castille, died suddenly in that city.</p>

<p>In a northerly direction the epidemic spread with equal
virulence. At Lyons evidence of the pestilence is afforded
by an inscription preserved in the town museum. It relates
to the construction of a chapel in 1352 by a citizen, "Michael
Pancsus," in which Mass should be said for the souls of
several members of his family "who died in the time of the
mortality, 1348."<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> The anonymous cleric of Bruges, who
preserved the Avignon letter, writing probably at the time,
gives the following account of its progress: "In the year
of our Lord 1348, that plague, epidemic, and mortality,
which we have mentioned before, by the will of God has
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p046"></a>[p046]</span> not ceased; but from day to day grows and descends upon
other parts. For in Burgundy, Normandy, and elsewhere
it has consumed, and is consuming, many thousands of men,
animals, and sheep."<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>It arrived in Normandy probably about the feast of St.
James (July 25th), 1348. A contemporary note in a manuscript,
which certainly came from the Abbey of Foucarmont,
gives the following account: "In the year of grace 1348,
about the feast of St. James, the great mortality entered
into Normandy. And it came into Gascony, and Poitou,
and Brittany, and then passed into Picardy. And it was
so horrible that in the towns it attacked more than two-thirds
of the population died. And a father did not dare
to go and visit his son, nor a brother his sister, and people
could not be found to nurse one another, because, when
the person breathed the breath of another he could not
escape. It came to such a pass that no one could be
found even to carry the corpses (to the tomb). People
said that the end of the world had come."<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> In another
manuscript, M. Delisle has found a further note, or portion
of a note, referring to the terrible nature of the malady in
Normandy. It never entered a city or town without carrying
off the greater part of the inhabitants. "And in that
time the mortality was so great among the people of Normandy
that those in Picardy mocked them."<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>Paris was, of course, visited by the disease. Apparently,
it was some time in the early summer of 1348 when it first
manifested itself. In the chronicle of St. Denis it is recorded
that "in the year of grace 1348 the said mortality
commenced in the Kingdom of France and lasted about a
year and a half, more or less. In this way there died in
Paris, one day with another, 800 persons.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. In the
space of the said year and a half, as some declare, the
number of the dead in Paris rose to more than 50,000, and
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p047"></a>[p047]</span> in the town of St. Denis the number was as high as
16,000."<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> The chronicle of the Carmelites at Rheims
places the total of deaths in Paris at the larger number
of 80,000,<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> amongst whom were two Queens, Joan
of Navarre, daughter of Louis X., and Joan of Burgundy,
wife of King Philip of Valois.</p>

<p>The most circumstantial account of the plague in France
at the time when the capital was attacked is given in the
continuation of the chronicle of William of Nangis, which
was written probably before 1368. "In the same year"
(1348), it says, "both in Paris in the kingdom of France,
and not less, as is reported, in different parts of the world,
and also in the following year, there was so great a
mortality of people of both sexes, and of the young rather
than the old, that they could hardly be buried. Further
they were ill scarcely more than two or three days, and
some often died suddenly, so that a man to-day in good
health, to-morrow was carried a corpse to the grave.
Lumps suddenly appeared under the arm-pits or in the
groin, and the appearance of these was an infallible sign
of death. This sickness, or pestilence, was called by the
doctors the epidemic. And the multitude of people who
died in the years 1348 and 1349, was so large that
nothing like it was ever heard, read of, or witnessed in
past ages. And the said death and sickness often sprung
from the imagination, or from the society and (consequent)
contagion of another, for a healthy man visiting one sick
hardly ever escaped death. So that in many towns, small
and great, priests retired through fear, leaving the administration
of the Sacraments to religious, who were more
bold. Briefly, in many places, there did not remain two
alive out of every twenty.</p>

<p>"So great was the mortality in the Hotel-Dieu of Paris
that for a long time more than fifty corpses were carried
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p048"></a>[p048]</span> away from it each day in carts to be buried.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> And the
devout sisters of the Hotel-Dieu, not fearing death, worked
piously and humbly, not out of regard for any worldly
honour. A great number of these said sisters were very
frequently summoned to their reward by death, and rest in
peace with Christ, as is piously believed."</p>

<p>After saying that the plague had passed through Gascony
and Spain, the chronicler speaks of it as going "from town
to town, village to village, from house to house, and even
from person to person; and coming into the country of
France, passed into Germany, where, however, it was less
severe than amongst us."</p>

<p>"It lasted in France," the writer says, "the greater part
of 1348 and 1349, and afterwards there were to be seen
many towns, country places, and houses in good cities
remaining empty and without inhabitants."</p>

<p>The writer concludes by declaring that nature soon
began to make up for losses. "But, alas! the world by
this renovation is not changed for the better. For people
were afterwards more avaricious and grasping, even when
they possessed more of the goods of this world, than
before. They were more covetous, vexing themselves by
contentious quarrels, strifes, and law suits." Moreover, all
things were much dearer; furniture, food, merchandise,
of all sorts doubled in price, and servants would work only
for higher wages. "Charity, too, from that time began to
grow cold, and wickedness with its attendant, ignorance,
was rampant, and few were found who could or would
teach children the rudiments of grammar in houses, cities,
or villages."<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p049"></a>[p049]</span></p>

<p>Whilst the plague was at its height King Philip VI.
requested the medical faculty of Paris to consult together
and to report upon the best methods by which the deadly
nature of the disease could be combated. The result of
their consultation was published, probably in June, 1348.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
Unfortunately, adhering closely to the text of the question
addressed to them, their reply does not furnish any
historical details. They broadly state their views as to the
probable origin of the epidemic, and confine themselves to
suggestions as to its treatment, and to the means by which
contagion is to be avoided. They are clear as to the
infectious nature of the disease, and earnest in their recommendations
that all who were able should have nothing to
do with the sick. "It is chiefly the people of one house,
and above all those of the same family, who are close
together," they say, "who die, for they are always near to
those who are sick. We advise them to depart, for it is in
this way that a great number have been infected by the
plague."<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the epidemic was spreading northward. At
Amiens, where 17,000 are said to have been carried off by
the sickness, it seems probable that the malady was not
at its height before the summer of the following year,
1349. The wave of pestilence from Paris seems to
have divided. One stream swept on through Normandy
towards the coast, which it probably reached, in the regions
round Calais, about July or August of the year 1348. The
other stream, checked probably by the autumn and winter,
made its way more slowly towards Belgium and Holland.</p>

<p>In the June of 1349 the King granted a petition from the
Mayor of Amiens for a new cemetery. In the document
the plague in the city is described as having been then so
terrible that the cemeteries are full, and no more corpses
could safely be buried in them. "The mortality in the said
town," says the King's letter, "is so marvellously great
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p050"></a>[p050]</span> that people are dying there suddenly, as quickly, as from
one evening to the following morning, and often even
quicker than that."<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> This was in June, 1349, and already
by September of the same year the authorities were called
upon to deal with a combination of workmen at a tannery
to secure for themselves excessive wages "to the great
hurt of the people at large." The promptness of the
action of the Mayor, and the tone of the proclamation
establishing a rate of wages, is a sufficient proof that
the crisis was regarded as serious.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> This trouble at
Amiens is an indication of difficulties which will be seen to
have existed elsewhere in France, in Germany, and in
England, which had their origin in the dearth of labourers
after the scourge had passed.</p>

<p>The account of the ravages of this great pestilence in
France, as well as its course in the city of Tournay, where
it commenced in August, 1349, is well given in the chronicle
of Gilles Li Muisis, Abbot of St. Martin's, Tournay, who
was a contemporary of the events he describes. "It is
impossible," he says, "to credit the mortality throughout
the whole country. Travellers, merchants, pilgrims, and
others who have passed through it declare that they have
found cattle wandering without herdsmen in fields, towns,
and waste lands; that they have seen barns and wine-cellars
standing wide open, houses empty, and few people to
be found anywhere. So much so that in many towns, cities
and villages, where there had been before 20,000 people,
scarcely 2,000 are left; and in many cities and country
places, where there had been 1,500 people, hardly 100
remain. And in many different lands (<em class="e000I2">multis climatibus</em>),
both lands and fields are lying uncultivated. I have heard
these things from a certain knight well skilled in the law,
who was one of the members of the Paris Parliament. He
was sent, together with a certain Bishop, by Philip, the most
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p051"></a>[p051]</span> illustrious King of France, to the King of Aragon, and on
his return journey passed through Avignon. Both there
and in Paris, as he told me, he was informed of the foresaid
things by many people worthy of credit."</p>

<p>After speaking of the evidence given by a pilgrim to
Santiago, Li Muisis proceeds to relate his own experiences
in Tournay in the summer of 1349. This he does in verse
and prose. The poem, after speaking of the manifestation
of God's anger, describes the plague beginning in
the East and passing through France into Flanders. Like
other writers, Li Muisis declares that he hesitates to say
what he has seen and heard, because posterity will hardly
credit what he would relate.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> The reports of all travellers
and merchants as to the terrible state of the country
generally give one and the same sad story of universal
death and distress. The particulars as to the plague in
Tournay, the writer's own city, may best be given from
his prose account.</p>

<p>John de Pratis, the Bishop of Tournay, was one of the
first to be carried off by the sickness. He had gone away
for change of air, and on Corpus Christi Day, June 11th,
1349, he carried the blessed Sacrament in the procession
at Arras. He left that city the next day for Cambray, but
died the day after almost suddenly.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> He was buried at
Tournay; and "time passed on," says our author, to the
beginning of August, up to which no other person of
authority died in Tournay. But after the feast of St. John
the plague began in the parish of St. Piat, in the quarter
of Merdenchor, and afterwards in other parishes. Every
day the bodies of the dead were borne to the churches,
now five, now ten, now fifteen, and in the parish of St.
Brice sometimes twenty or thirty. In all parish churches
the curates, parish clerks, and sextons to get their fees,
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p052"></a>[p052]</span> rang morning, evening, and night the passing bells, and by
this the whole people of the city, both men and women,
began to be filled with fear.</p>

<p>The officials of the town consequently seeing that the
Dean and Chapter, and the clerics generally, did not care
to remedy this matter, since it was in their interest it should
go on, as they made profit out of it, having taken counsel
together, issued certain orders. Men and women who,
although not married, were living together as man and wife,
were commanded either to marry or forthwith to separate.
The bodies of the dead were to be buried immediately in
graves at least six feet deep. There was to be no tolling
of any bell at funerals. The corpse was not to be taken to
the church, but at the service only a pall was to be spread
on the ground, whilst after the service there was to be no
gathering together at the houses of the deceased. Further,
all work after noon on Saturdays and during the entire
Sunday was prohibited, as also was the playing of dice and
making use of profane oaths.</p>

<p>These ordinances having lasted for a time, and the sickness
still further increasing, it was proclaimed on St.
Matthew's Day (September 24th) that there should be no
more ringing of bells, that not more than two were to meet
for any funeral service, and that no one was to dress in
black. This action of the city authorities, the writer
declares to have been most beneficial. In his own knowledge,
he says, many who had hitherto been living in a
state of concubinage were married, that the practice of
swearing notably diminished, and that dice were so little
used that the manufacturers turned "the square-shaped
dice" into "round objects on which people told their
<em class="e000I2">Pater Nosters</em>."</p>

<p>I have tried, says our author, to write what I know, "and
let future generations believe that in Tournay there was a
marvellous mortality. I heard from many about Christmas
time who professed to know it as a fact that more than
25,000 persons had died in Tournay, and it was strange
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p053"></a>[p053]</span> that the mortality was especially great among the chief
people and the rich. Of those who used wine and kept away
from the tainted air and visiting the sick few or none died.
But those visiting and frequenting the houses of the sick
either became grievously ill or died. Deaths were more
numerous about the market places and in poor narrow streets
than in broader and more spacious areas. And whenever one
or two people died in any house, at once, or at least in a short
space of time, the rest of the household were carried off.
So much so, that very often in one home ten or more
ended their lives together, and in many houses the dogs
and even cats died. Hence no one, whether rich, in
moderate circumstances, or poor, was secure, but everyone
from day to day waited on the will of the Lord. And
certainly great was the number of curates and chaplains
hearing confessions and administering the Sacraments, and
even of parish clerks visiting the sick with them, who
died."</p>

<p>In the parishes across the river, the mortality was as
great as in Tournay itself. Although death as a rule came
so suddenly, still the people for the most part were able to
receive the Sacraments. The rapidity of the disease,
remarked upon by Petrarch and Boccaccio in Italy, is also
spoken of in the same terms by the Abbot of St. Martin's.
People that one had seen apparently well and had spoken
to one evening were reported dead next day. He
specially remarks upon the mortality among the clergy
visiting the sick,<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> and speaks of the creation of two new
cemeteries outside the walls of the town. One was in a
field near the Leper House <em class="e000I2">De Valle</em>, the other at the
religious house of the Crutched Friars. Strange to say Li
Muisis speaks of the disfavour with which this necessary
precaution of establishing new grave-yards was regarded.
People, he says, grumbled because they were no longer
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p054"></a>[p054]</span> allowed to be buried in their own family vaults. The town
authorities, however, were firm, and as the pestilence increased
deep pits were dug in these two common burying
places, and into them numbers of bodies were constantly
being thrown and covered up with a slight layer of earth.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>It has been supposed by many that the accounts given
by contemporary writers of the excessive mortality
throughout the countries of Europe must be greatly
exaggerated, and that the population in the middle of the
fourteenth century was not sufficiently large to allow of
the number of deaths. On the one hand it is evident that
in the majority of cases the round figures stated can be at
most nothing more than a rough approximation of the
actual deaths, and that the natural tendency of those who
have witnessed a catastrophe as great and as universal as
that of the plague of 1348 and subsequent years, is to
magnify, rather than to diminish, the disaster. On the
other hand, whilst allowing that in most cases the actual
figures are little more than guesses at the truth, and can
only be taken as evidence of the belief of the age in the
magnitude of the mortality, it must be admitted that Italy,
France, and other countries of Europe were at the time
more teeming with population than is perhaps usually
understood.</p>

<p>M. Siméon Luce has made a special study of the conditions
of French popular life at this period,<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> and the conclusions
at which he has arrived may be here usefully
stated in brief. It has been proved by the labours of
French antiquaries that the general population of France
before the great pestilence of 1348–1349, and the hundred
years' war with England, was equal to what it is in the
present century. Numerous villages were scattered over
the face of the country, every trace of which has now
disappeared. The houses, or rather huts, in which the
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p055"></a>[p055]</span> population of rural France lived were very seldom
framed of any kind of masonry, but were for the most part
merely four mud, or clay, walls, and sometimes wickerwork
lined, and the interstices filled in, with hay and straw.
As a rule there was but one storey, although some, chiefly
taverns and places of that class, had an upper floor. The
roof was thatched or covered with wood or stone; windows
were the exception, and where they did exist they were
mere slits in the clay walls closed with wooden shutters.
Even the coarse, opaque glass then made was beyond the
means of the ordinary peasant and farmer, whilst just
about this time even a rich bourgeois of Paris recommended
the filling of windows with waxen cloth or parchment.
The doors were fastened with wooden latches, and
over them, according to the general arrangement, a shutter
of wood was fixed which was generally left open for air,
light, and to allow the smoke of the brushwood fire to pass
out of the living room. It will be readily understood how
the condition of life in houses such as these would not be
such as to put much obstacle to the spread of an epidemic
in the rural districts; whilst if such tenements were vacant
even for a short time they would readily fall into decay and
would present the spectacle of ruin and desolation spoken
of by so many writers of the period as caused by the great
pestilence.</p>

<p>The furniture of these houses was simple, but very much
what it is now in small country houses. The inventories
of the period show that most houses had vessels of copper,
tin and glass, and that there were few who did not possess
some articles of silver. The people for the most part lived
on a soup of bread and meal; but even by the fourteenth
century white bread was by no means unknown. The
principal meat was pork fed in the forests, but most
cottages possessed a spit upon which fowls, previously
larded, were occasionally roasted. Of condiments, mustard
was the chief, and it was much, if not universally, used.
Even in the humblest houses a cloth would be spread on
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p056"></a>[p056]</span> the table at meals. For drink there was the wine of the
country, and in Normandy cider was plentiful. With the
drink, especially in taverns, which were exceedingly
numerous, a little ginger would generally be mixed. In
dress fur of various kinds was much used, and, by the time
of this pestilence, in France the use of the linen shirt as an
undergarment had become almost universal. The sleeping
places were dark, airless recesses, in which the people,
having divested themselves of all clothing, rested upon
straw mattresses, or sometimes on feather beds. Contrary
to the opinion entertained by persons of repute there is
evidence to show that bathing was common and much
used especially among the lower classes, and that even
small villages had their public bath places.</p>

<p>This sketch of the epidemic in these regions may be concluded
by one or two instances of the agrarian difficulties
which followed upon it. On August 16th, 1349, the Emperor
Charles IV. issued an order to the tenants of the Abbey of
St. Trond, in the diocese of Liège, to return to their
obedience. The document says that the holders of the
Abbey lands and other dependents are now demanding
their own terms and claiming liberty to do what they like,
with the result that the Abbot and monastery are so
distressed in temporal matters that absolute ruin is impending.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
The second instance is that of the Abbey of St.
John at Laon. A document, addressed by the French
King Charles to the Abbot and convent, says that the
monastery is so decayed in revenues that it is impossible
to keep up the fitting and proper services of the Church.
And although the letter was not written till nearly the
close of the century—1392–3—the cause assigned for this
poverty and decay is "the great mortality which took place
about the year 1349," by which the tithes and other
revenues were destroyed.</p>

<p>And to quote but one more example: "On 5th July,
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p057"></a>[p057]</span>
1352, relief was granted to the inhabitants of the town of
Arras because by reason of the wars, and because of the
mortality which has been universal in the world, the said
city is so greatly decayed, both as to buildings and people,
as also in revenues and temporal goods, that it is on the
high road to (absolute)
desolation."<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<a id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.
<span class="smaller">THE PLAGUE IN OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.</span></h2>

<p class="chap-first">In following the great pestilence through Europe, according
to the historical sequence of events, its course
in England should be now described. Inasmuch, however,
as the story of the ravages caused by the disease in England
will be told in greater detail, it may conveniently be left till
the last. Here a brief account may be interposed of the
mortality in other European countries, although it will take
the reader to the year 1351.</p>

<p>From Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica the plague was carried
to the Balearic Islands. The three streams of infection
met with destructive force at Majorca. The historian
Zurita declares that in less than a month 15,000 persons
had perished on the island. Another writer estimates
the total loss of life during the epidemic at double that
number, and some ancient records have been quoted as
stating that in the island eight out of every ten people must
have died, a proportion, of course, exaggerated, but sufficient
to show local tradition as to the extent of the misfortune.
In the monasteries and convents, according to
this authority, not one religious was left; and the Dominicans
are said to have been obliged to recruit their numbers
by enrolling quite young children.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>The scourge fell upon Spain in the early part of the
year 1348. It is supposed to have first appeared at Almeira,
and in Barcelona whole quarters of the city were depopulated
and rendered desolate by it. In May, 1348, it was
already raging in Valencia, and by midsummer 300 persons
a day are reported to have been buried in the city. At
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p059"></a>[p059]</span> Saragossa, where Pedro IV. then was, the malady was at its
height in September. The people here, as elsewhere, became
hardened, and charity died out in the presence of the
terrors of death. They fled from the sick, leaving them to
die alone, and abandoned the corpses of the dead in the
streets. Most of the cities and villages of Spain suffered
more or less severely, and the sickness appears to have
lingered longer here than in most other countries. The
new Queen of Aragon had been one of the earliest
victims; Alphonsus XI. was one of the last. In March,
1350, he was laying siege to Gibraltar, when the plague
broke out suddenly with great violence amongst his troops.
He refused to retire, as his officers desired him to do, and
fell a victim to the epidemic on Good Friday, March 26th,
1350.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>An interesting account of Northern Spain during the
plague is given in the chronicle of Li Muisis, Abbot of St.
Martin's, Tournay, from which much was cited in the previous
chapter. The writer says that he learnt the details
from "a pilgrim, who, in going to St. James' (of Compostella),
passed by Notre Dame de Roc Amadour<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> and by
Toulouse, because by reason of the wars he could not travel
the usual way." This pilgrim to Compostella, in the middle
of the 14th century, would consequently have crossed the
Pyrenees by one of the passes into Navarre, and so travelled
along the north of Spain to Santiago. Having performed
his pilgrimage, Li Muisis informs us that he returned
through Galicia, and "with his companion, reached a town
named Salvaterra," probably the place now called Salvatierra,
situated below the Pyrenees, and just above the
Sierra de la Pena. This town, as the traveller reported,
"was so depopulated by the mortality that not one person
out of ten had been left alive. The city itself was fairly
large. The said pilgrim related," says Li Muisis, "that
after supping with the host (who, with two daughters and
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p060"></a>[p060]</span> one servant, had alone so far survived of his entire family,
and who was not then conscious of any sickness upon him),
he settled with him for his entertainment, intending to start
on his journey at daybreak, and went to bed. Next morning
rising and wanting something from those with whom they
had supped, the travellers could make no one hear. Then
they learnt from an old woman they found in bed that the
host, his two daughters, and servant had died in the night.
On hearing this the pilgrims made all haste to leave the
place."<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>From North Italy the pestilence soon spread to the
country across the Adriatic, if indeed it had not already
been infected independently, as seems more than probable,
by ships from the East. The port of Ragusa, in Dalmatia,
is said to have been attacked as early as January 13th, 1348,
and more than 7,000 are reported as having been swept
away by it. A letter sent in April to the authorities "condoles
with them on the terrible mortality, by which the
population had been so greatly diminished."<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> At Spalatro,
on March 22nd, 1348, the Archbishop Dominic de Lucaris
died of the disease, and it is known to have raged for some
months in the city. An anonymous chronicler of Spalatro
in the 15th century, who professed to take his account of
this period from ancient records, declares that it is impossible
to picture "the terrors and miseries of these unhappy
days." To add to the horror of the situation, as he
declares, wolves and other wild animals came down from
the mountains and fell upon the plague-stricken city and
boldly attacked the survivors. The same writer notes the
rapidity with which the disease carried off those it attacked.
According to him, when swellings or carbuncles appeared
on any part of the body all hope of saving the life of the
patient was abandoned. As a rule, those stricken in this
way died in three or at most four days, and so great was
the general mortality that bodies were left lying unburied
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p061"></a>[p061]</span> in the streets because there were none to carry them to the
grave.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>Further north again, Sebenico, through intercourse with
which, very possibly, the plague was carried into Hungary,
was attacked in the spring of the same year, 1348. By the
8th of May the Count of Sebenico had written a description
of the wretched condition and state of the city, by
reason of the great mortality in those parts, through which
it had been left almost without inhabitants.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Istria, on
August 27th, 1348, was declared in a Venetian State paper
to have suffered greatly. The people left, especially in
the city of Pola, were very few, so many having been
swept away "by the late pestilence."<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>From Venice the epidemic spread northwards into
Austria and Hungary. Attacking on its way Padua and
Verona, it passed up the valley of the Etsch and was
already at Trent on June 2nd, 1348. Thence it spread
quickly through Botzen up the Brenner Pass, in the
Tyrolese Alps, and was at Muhldorf on the Inn, in Bavaria
on June 29th, 1348.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> Here it seems to have lasted for a
considerable time. One chronicler, writing of the subsequent
year, 1349, says "that from the feast of St. Michael,
1348, there perished in Muhldorf 1,400 of the better class
of inhabitants."<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> Another, speaking of the plague generally,
says "that it raged so terribly in Carinthia, Austria,
and Bavaria that many cities were depopulated, and in
some towns which it visited many
families were destroyed
so completely that not a member was found to have survived."<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>In November of the same year, 1348, the epidemic is
found in Styria, at Neuberg, in the valley of the Mürz.
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p062"></a>[p062]</span> The Neuberg Chronicle, giving an account of it, says,
"Since this deadly pestilence raged everywhere, cities
became desolate which up to this had been populous. Their
inhabitants were swept off in such numbers that such as
were left, with closed gates, strenuously watched that no
one should steal the property of those departed." After
speaking of Venice, it continues, "The pest in its wanderings
came to Carinthia, and then so completely took
possession of Styria, that people, rendered desperate,
walked about as if mad."</p>

<p>"From so many sick pestilential odours proceeded,
infecting those visiting and serving them, and very frequently
it happened that when one died in a house all, one
after the other, were carried off. So certain was this that
no one could be found to stop in the houses of the sick,
and relations, as if in the natural course of events, seem
to die all together. As a consequence of this overwhelming
visitation cattle were left to wander in the fields without
guardians, for no one thought of troubling himself about
the future; and wolves coming down from the mountains
to attack them, against their instincts, and as if frightened
by something unseen, quickly fled into the wilds again.
Property, too, both moveable and immoveable, which sick
people leave by will, is carefully avoided by all, as if it
were sure to be infected. The sickness&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. declined
about the feast of St. Martin (November 11th), 1348, and
at Neuberg it had carried off many monks and inhabitants."<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>It is necessary to return once again to North Italy, from
which another wave of pestilence rolled on to Switzerland.
The contemporary—but not very accurate—notary of
Novara, Peter Azarius, speaks to the fact of the plague
being at Momo, Gallarete, Varese, and Bellinzona, on<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> the
great highway over the Alps through the St. Gothard Pass,
and all in the immediate neighbourhood of his home.
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p063"></a>[p063]</span> What Azarius says from personal experience of this terrible
time is of interest. He had left his house at Novara for fear
of the disease, and resting for a while in the town of Tortona,
he occupied himself in philosophising upon the misfortunes
which had fallen upon Lombardy, and the strange
unchristian neglect of the sick he could hardly help
noticing. "I have seen," he says, "a rich man perish,
who, even by offering an immense sum of money, could get
no one to help him. Through fear of the infection I have
seen a father not caring for his son, nor a son for his
father, nor a brother for a brother, nor a friend for his
friend, nor a neighbour for his neighbour. And what was
worse than this, I have seen a family, although one of high
position, miserably perish, not being able to get any help
or assistance. Medicine being useless, the strong and the
young, men and women, were struck down in a moment,
and all the infected were so shunned that none dared even
to enter their houses."<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>From the pass of St. Gothard the epidemic passed down
the Rhine Valley, and before the close of 1348 was in the
neighbourhood of Dissentis; whilst by May, 1349, the
district round about the monastery of Pfäffers, half way
between the pass of St. Gothard and Lake Constance, had
been attacked. Shortly afterwards the country near the
celebrated Abbey of St. Gall was likewise greatly afflicted.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile another wave of pestilence passed into
Switzerland from the side of France. Avignon had been
attacked, as it has been shown, in the early part of 1348,
and thence the infection was carried up the Rhone Valley
to the Lake of Geneva. Thence one stream passed in a
north-easterly direction over Switzerland, and a second
followed the course of the river Rhone. By the 17th of
March, 1349, the plague was at Ruswyl, in the neighbourhood
of Lucerne, having passed through Berne on its way.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
At Lucerne alone 3,000 people are said to have died of the
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p064"></a>[p064]</span> disease. It must have remained about the neighbourhood
of this lake for some months, for it was not until September,
1349, that it is known to have manifested its presence in
the high and healthy valley of Engelberg. "This year
(1349)," says the chronicler of the Abbey of Engelberg,
"the pestilence or mortality was great, and, indeed, most
great, in this valley, so that more than twenty houses were
left empty without an inhabitant. In the same year from
the feast of Our Lady's nativity, September 8th, to the
feast of the Epiphany 116 of our nuns died in the cloister.
One of the first to die was the Superior Catherine;
about the middle (of the epidemic) the venerable Mother
Beatrix, Countess of Arberg, formerly Superior; and on
the morrow of Holy Innocents, Mechtilde of Wolfenschiessen,
the new Superior likewise passed away. And
of our own numbers (there died) two priests and five
scholars."<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Basle was attacked, and is said to have lost
some 14,000 people about the middle of the year; Zurich
about September 11th; and Constance some time during
the winter.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to follow the wanderings of the great
mortality in detail further through Europe. The annals of
almost every country prove incontestably that most places
were in turn visited, and more or less depopulated, by the
epidemic. By April 4th, 1349, it was reported in Venice
that the pestilence was raging in Hungary, and by June 7th
the King could declare "that by Divine mercy it had now
ceased in our kingdom." It must consequently have commenced
in the country in the early part of the year,
although there is evidence that it was still to be found
in some parts in October of the same year. Poland was
attacked about the same time as Hungary. Here it is
said many of the nobility died. There seemed no help for
the daily misfortunes. The sickness rendered desolate not
alone numberless houses, but even towns and villages.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p065"></a>[p065]</span></p>

<p>It has been already pointed out that the pestilence had
reached Neuberg, in Styria, by the autumn of the year
1348. It was only the following year, about the feast of
St. John the Baptist, June 24th, 1349, that such a plague as
never before was either heard or seen was raging in
Vienna.</p>

<p>It commenced seemingly about Easter time, and lasted till
St. Michael's, and a third part of the population was carried
off by it.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Each day there died 500 or 600, and one day
960.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> The dead were buried in trenches, each of which,
according to one chronicle, contained some 6,000 corpses.
The parish of St. Stephen lost 54 ecclesiastics during the
course of the epidemic, and when it passed some 70 families
were found to be entirely extinct, whilst the property of
many more had passed into the hands of very distant
relations.</p>

<p>Another account declares that in the city and neighbourhood
barely a third of the population survived.
"Because of the odour, and horror inspired by the dead
bodies, burials in the church cemeteries were not allowed;
but as soon as life was extinct the corpses were carried out
of the city to a common burial-place (called) 'God's acre.'
There the deep and broad pits were quickly filled to the top
with the dead. And this plague lasted from Pentecost to
St. Michael's; and not alone in Vienna, but in the surrounding
country it raged with great fury. It spared not
the monks and the nuns, for in (the Cistercian Abbey of)
Heiligenkreuz 53 religious at the same time passed out of
this life."<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>In Bohemia the winter cold apparently put a stop to the
sickness at its commencement. "The mortality commenced
to be severe in Bohemia, but the recent cold and snow
stayed it." However, "in the year 1350 the plague again
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p066"></a>[p066]</span> devastated various countries, and then in Bohemia likewise
it was to be found."<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>The wave of pestilence which passed up the Rhine
Valley and attacked Basle passed on to Colmar, and appeared
in Strasburg in July, 1349.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> At the end of the same
year, about December 18th, it had reached Cologne. "In
the first year of archbishop William von Gennep (who
succeeded to the See of that city on the above date) there
was," says the chronicle, "a great pestilence in Cologne
and its neighbourhood."<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the wave had divided lower down the valley
of the Rhine, for in the summer of 1349 the plague was
raging at Frankfort. "In that year," writes Caspar
Camentz, "from the feast of St. Mary Magdalene (June
22nd) to the feast of the Purification following (February
2nd, 1350) the universal pestilence was at Frankfort.
In the space of 72 days more than 2,000 people died.
Every second hour they were buried without bell,
priest, or candle. On one day 35 were buried at one
time."<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>During 1349 and 1350 the pestilence was rife in the
towns and country places of Prussia. In the latter year it
attacked Bremen in the far north, and in the following year
the authorities of the city took a census of the numbers
that had been carried off by it. "In the year of our Lord
1350," the account says, "the plague had gone round the
world and had visited Bremen, and the Council determined
to take the number of the dead, and it was found that of
known and named people there were (entered on the list)
in the parish of St. Mary 1,816; in that of St. Martin,
1,415; in St. Anschar's, 1,922; and in St. Stephen's, 1,813;
moreover, numberless people had died in the fields beyond
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p067"></a>[p067]</span> the walls and in cemeteries, the number of whom, as known
and described, reached almost 7,000."<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>From Flanders, where the pestilence was at Tournay in
December, 1349, as before reported, the epidemic spread
into Holland. Here in the following year its progress was
marked by the same great mortality, especially among those
who lived together in monasteries and convents. "At this
time," writes the chronicler, "the plague raged in Holland
as furiously as has ever been seen. People died walking
in the streets. In the Monastery of Fleurchamps 80 died,
including monks and lay brethren. In the Abbey of
Foswert, which was a double monastery for men and women,
207 died, including monks, nuns, lay brethren, and lay
sisters."<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>This brief review of the progress of the plague in
Europe will be sufficient to show that the mortality and
consequent distress were universal. The northern countries
of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden received the
infection from England. As will be seen subsequently,
the northern parts of England were troubled with the
epidemic in the late summer and autumn of 1349, and
either from a port on the eastern coast, or from London,
the plague was brought over in a ship. Lagerbring, a
Swedish historian of repute, says that a ship with a
cargo of woollen cloth sailed out of the port of London
early in the summer of 1349.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> The plague had
been very great in the English capital, and all the
crew died whilst the ship was at sea. Driven about
by the winds and currents the fatal bark was cast on
the shore at Bergen, in Norway. The epidemic
spread quickly over the entire country. The Archbishop
of Drontheim and all his Chapter, with one single
exception, died, and the survivor was nominated
Archbishop. Most of his suffragans were also carried
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p068"></a>[p068]</span> off.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Several families who had fled from Bergen to avoid
the infection died in the mountains to which they had
retired.</p>

<p>Another Swedish historian states that in the country of
West-Gotland alone 466 priests were swept away by the
plague. In that district then there were about 479
churches, many of which were served by more than one
priest, so that the number given may not be altogether
improbable.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> It is stated that in Norway there long existed
what were called <em class="e000I2">Find-dale</em>—wildernesses—in which were
unmistakable traces of cultivation, and after the plague
there is evidence of a state of exhaustion and a dearth of
inhabitants, which lasted for several generations, so that
forests grew where there had once been churches and
villages.</p>

<p>Some interesting particulars may be gathered about the
town of Wisby, on the Isle of Gotland. The annals of the
Franciscan convent note that the plague raged in 1350.
In the necrology of the same house are entered the
names of a great number of friars and many novices
who died in this fatal year, and the comparison of one
portion of the necrology with another, in which the names
are collected into groups, shows that the worst time at
Wisby was in July, August, and September, 1350.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> In
all twenty-four friars, a very large proportion of the convent,
appear to have been carried off by the epidemic. In
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p069"></a>[p069]</span> the Cathedral of Wisby five sepulchral slabs are still preserved
with the date 1350, whilst of such memorials as
have escaped destruction not more than a single one
remains for any other year.</p>

<p>The King of Sweden, Magnus II., in 1350 addressed
letters patent to his people, wherein he says that "God for
the sins of man has struck the world with this great
punishment of sudden death. By it most of the people
in the land to the west of our country (<em class="e000I2">i.e.</em>, Norway) are
dead. It is now ravaging in Norway and Holland, and is
approaching our kingdom of Sweden." The king therefore
summons them to abstain on every Friday from all
food but bread and water, or "at most to take only bread
and ale," to walk with bare feet to their parish churches,
and to go in procession round about the cemeteries attached
to them, carrying with them the holy relics.</p>

<p>In the capital of Sweden, when the plague burst upon
the country, it is recorded that "the streets were strewn
with corpses," and among the victims are named Hacon
and Knut, two brothers of the king.</p>

<p>Denmark and Sleswig Holstein suffered from the pestilence
at the same time as Norway and Sweden. In one
chronicle it is called "a most grievous plague of buboes;"
in another it is recorded that in the year 1350 "a great plague
and sudden death raged both in the case of men and in that
of cattle."<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> The accounts of the Bishopric of Roskild, on the
Isle of Zealand, about the year 1370, or twenty years after
this plague had passed, show the state of universal desolation
to which the country was reduced. Lands are
described as lying idle and uncultivated, villages and houses
desolate and uninhabited. Property that formerly used to
bring in four marks, or 48 "pund," now produced only 18
"pund." The same story is repeated on almost every page
throughout these long accounts.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>A few words only need now be said of the desolation
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p070"></a>[p070]</span> which everywhere throughout Europe was naturally the
consequence of the great pestilence. Of North Italy John
of Parma writes that "at the time (1348) labourers could
not be got, and the harvest remained on the fields, since
there was none to gather it in."<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> Twenty years after the
pestilence, in 1372, it is said of Mayence that "it is indubitable
and notorious that because of the terrible character of
the pestilence and mortality which suddenly swept away
labourers, copyholders (<em class="e000I2">parciarios</em>) and farmers, even the
most robust, labourers are to-day few and rare, for which
reason many fields remain uncultivated and deserted."<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
Again, in 1359, Henry, Bishop of Constance, impropriated
to the monastery of St. Gall, in Switzerland, the
Church of Marbach and others, to enable the abbey "to
keep up its hospitality, bestow alms, and fulfil its other
duties," and he assigns as a reason why it cannot now
do this "that by the epidemic or mortality of people,
which by permission of God has existed in these
parts, the number of farmers and other retainers of
both sexes of this abbey, belonging by law of service to
the said monastery, which has passed from this life to the
Lord (has been so great) that many of the possessions of
this monastery have remained, on account of the said death,
uncultivated, and no proper return comes from them."<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<h2 title="Chapter V. The Plague Reaches England.">
<a id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.
<span class="smaller">THE PLAGUE REACHES ENGLAND.</span></h2>

<p class="chap-first">The plague first attacked England in the autumn of 1348.
It has already been pointed out that Northern France was
suffering under the scourge in the summer of that year, and
that in August the pestilence had visited Normandy and
was found at Calais, then in possession of the English.
Probably, also, at this time, Jersey and Guernsey, with
which England was in constant communication, were decimated
by the disease. So greatly did these islands suffer
that the King's taxes, usually raised upon the fishing industries,
could not be levied. "By reason," writes the
English King to John Mautravers, the Governor, "of the
mortality among the people and fishing folk of these islands,
which here as elsewhere has been so great, our rent for the
fishing, which has been yearly paid us, cannot be now obtained
without the impoverishing and excessive oppression
of those fishermen still left."<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>Rumours of the coming scourge reached England in the
early summer. On August 17th, 1348, the Bishop of Bath
and Wells, Ralph of Shrewsbury, sent letters through his
diocese ordering "processions and stations every Friday, in
each collegiate, regular, and parish church, to beg God to
protect the people from the pestilence which had come from
the East into the neighbouring kingdom," and granting an
indulgence of forty days to all who, being in a state of
grace, should give alms, fast or pray, in order, if possible,
to avert God's anger.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>The "neighbouring kingdom" spoken of by the Bishop
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p072"></a>[p072]</span> in his letter may be taken almost certainly to refer to
France. From Calais it is probable that the pestilence
was brought into England in certain ships conveying some
who were anxious to escape from it. Most of the contemporary
accounts agree in naming the coast of Dorsetshire
as the part first infected. Thus Galfrid le Baker, a contemporary,
says "it came first to a seaport in Dorsetshire,
and then into the country, which it almost deprived
of inhabitants, and from thence it passed into Devon and
Somerset to Bristol."<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> Two or three of the chronicles,
also, more particular than the rest, name Melcombe
Regis as the memorable spot where the epidemic first
showed itself in England. "In the year of our Lord 1348,
about the feast of the Translation of St. Thomas (July
7th)," writes the author of the chronicle known as the
<em class="e000I2">Eulogium Historiarum</em>, who was a monk of Malmesbury
at this time, "the cruel pestilence, terrible to all future
ages, came from parts over the sea to the south coast of
England, into a port called Melcombe, in Dorsetshire.
This (plague) sweeping over the southern districts,
destroyed numberless people in Dorset, Devon, and
Somerset."<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> So, too, a continuation of Trivet's chronicle,
taken down to the death of Edward III. by a canon of
Bridlington, who was thus probably a contemporary of
the event, says that "the great plague came into England
to the southern districts, beginning by some (ships)
putting in from the sea into a town called Melcombe."<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>Melcombe Regis, or Weymouth, was at that time a port
of considerable importance. In 1347–8, for example, it
furnished Edward III., for his siege of Calais, with 20 ships
and 264 mariners; whilst Bristol sent only 22 ships and
608 sailors, and even London but 25 boats and 662 men.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p073"></a>[p073]</span> This fact is of interest, not merely as showing the importance
of Melcombe Regis as a port on the southern
coast, but as evidence actually connecting the place at this
very period with Calais, and, doubtless, with other coast
towns of France. It is not at all improbable that by the
return of some of the Melcombe boats from Calais, the
epidemic may have been conveyed into the town. No
evidence is known to exist as to the mortality in the port
itself; but an item of information as to the effect of the
disease in the neighbourhood is afforded at a subsequent
period. Three years after the plague had passed the King,
by his letters patent, forbade any of the inhabitants of the
island of Portland to leave their homes there, or, indeed, to
sell any of their crops out of the district, "because," he
says, "as we have learnt, the island of Portland, in the
county of Dorset, has been so depopulated in the time of
the late pestilence that the inhabitants remaining are not
sufficiently numerous to protect it against our foreign
enemies."<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>The actual date when the pestilence first showed itself
in Dorsetshire has been considered somewhat doubtful.
The earliest day suggested is that assigned by the monk of
Malmesbury in his <em class="e000I2">Eulogium Historiarum</em>, who names
July 7th (1348) as the time when it commenced at Melcombe
Regis. The latest date is that given by Knighton,
the sub-contemporary canon of Leicester, who mentions
generally that it began in the autumn of the year 1348.
One chronicle gives July 25th, and two others August 1st,
whilst another merely names August as the month. Under
these circumstances, and in view of the fact that its arrival
in England was apparently unknown to the Bishop of Bath
and Wells, who was then in his diocese, in the middle of
August, it seems more than likely that the terrible scourge
did not make itself felt in the West of England until after
the middle of that month and not later than its end.
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p074"></a>[p074]</span></p>

<p>The early commencement of the disease is borne out by
a document in the archives of the Dean and Chapter of
Canterbury. Archbishop Strafford died on St. Bartholomew's
Eve, August 23rd, 1348, and before the end of
September the Prior of Canterbury, acting with archiepiscopal
power during the vacancy, addressed a mandate
to the Bishop of London, as the Dean of the College of
Bishops, to issue directions to the suffragans of Canterbury
to hold public processions in their respective dioceses to
pray God's aid against "the mortality" which was already
assuming alarming proportions.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>The summer and autumn of 1348 were abnormally wet in
England, and the chronicles record that from St. John the
Baptist's Day (June 24th) to Christmas it rained either by
night or by day with hardly an exception. In such a
season, naturally unhealthy, the sickness, of its own nature
most deadly, found every condition suitable for its rapid
development.</p>

<p>Starting from Melcombe Regis, the wave of contagion
spread itself very quickly over Dorset, Devon, and
Somerset, with the other counties comprised in the dioceses
of Salisbury, Exeter, and Wells. "It passed," writes
Robert of Avesbury, the contemporary Registrar of the
Court of Canterbury, "most rapidly from place to place,
swiftly killing ere mid-day many who in the morning had
been well, and without respect of persons (some few rich
people excepted), not permitting those destined to die to
live more than three, or at most four, days. On the same
day twenty, forty, sixty, and very often more corpses were
committed to the same grave."<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> In fact, over the West of
England during the late autumn of 1348 and the first months
of the following year the words of the old play must have
had only too true an application—</p>

<div class="poembox">
<p class="center">"One news straight came huddling on another</p>
<p class="center">Of death, and death, and death."
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p075"></a>[p075]</span></p>
</div>

<p>In dealing with a case of this kind a first object is to
control as far as possible, by means of definite statistics,
the general and vague statements of chroniclers and other
contemporary writers; whilst in the absence of such
statistics lies one of the great difficulties in dealing with the
history of the Middle Ages. Owing partly to the troublesome
and intricate nature of the subject, as well as to the
poverty of the material and the inherent dryness of such
matters, modern writers have made little advance to a more
correct knowledge of the population of European countries
in those ages. Much, however, might be done. As usual,
the ecclesiastical documents form the surest basis for any
calculation, and the episcopal registers enable us to arrive
at actual numbers. Accordingly, in the present inquiry,
these registers are of the highest importance, and it is
necessary constantly to recur to them, as they furnish the
only means of arriving at any adequate knowledge of the
proportion of the population swept away by the plague.
Possibly the mortality may have been greater among
ecclesiastics than among lay persons; but only from the
number of the clergy carried off by the epidemic can an
estimate be formed as to the number of lay people who
died. Accordingly, in the course of this work, the mortality
of the clergy is systematically investigated.</p>

<p>To understand the nature and value of the evidence thus
afforded as to the extent of the mortality, a few words of
explanation are necessary. In each diocese there was kept
by the Bishop's Registrar a list of all the institutions made
to vacant benefices by the Bishop. As a rule, not only was
the name of the place and of the out-going and the incoming
incumbent, together with the date expressed, but the
reason of the vacancy was stated, whether arising from death,
exchange, or resignation. These lists, then, for the fatal
period, or the autumn of 1348 and the year 1349, afford
some means of gauging the extent of the mortality among
the clergy. It must, however, be borne in mind that these
registers record only the institutions of the actual
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p076"></a>[p076]</span> incumbents, and take no account of the larger body of curates and
chaplains, to say nothing of the monks, canons, and friars
of a diocese. It has been calculated by a recent writer
that non-beneficed clergy more than equal in numbers the
holders of benefices, and that the total number of institutions
of a diocese may fairly be doubled in estimating the
deaths of the clergy during this epidemic.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> These Books
of Institutions, moreover, by furnishing the dates of the
appointments made to various livings, afford a means of
determining, at least approximately, the time when the
plague was rife in a district, and even, making allowances
for any delay in filling up the benefice, in any given place.</p>

<p>Besides the special register of each diocese a series of
official state documents, called the <em class="e000I2">Patent Rolls</em>, contains
much evidence of the destructive powers of the disease.
On these rolls, amongst every variety of public document,
are entered royal grants, licenses, and presentations made
by the Sovereign to such vacant ecclesiastical livings as
were at the time in the royal gift. These were ordinarily—</p>

<p>(1) Benefices of which the King was by right the patron.</p>

<p>(2) Those to which he presented, as guardian of the sons
of tenants <em class="e000I2">in capite</em> during their minority, and</p>

<p>(3) Livings to which bishops and abbots of sees and
monasteries, then vacant, ordinarily presented. At this
period, 1348–9, moreover, the royal presentations were
largely augmented by the patronage attached to the alien
religious houses existing in England, the possession of
which, "by reason of his war with France," as the official
phrase runs, "the King had seized into his own hands."</p>

<p>The evidence of the mortality among the beneficed clergy
during the great pestilence, as witnessed by the entries on
the patent rolls, may be here briefly summarised. In 1348,
in the period from January to May, the King presented to
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p077"></a>[p077]</span> 42 livings, and to 36 during the following four months;
so that in the eight months, immediately before the arrival
of the plague in England, the average number of presentations
monthly was below ten, the previous <em class="e000I2">yearly</em> average
being hardly more than a hundred. The roll, upon which
are entered the grants and presentations from September
to the close of the year, affords conclusive proof that in the
last four months of the year 1348 death had been busy
among those holding royal preferments. Eighty-one more
livings had to be filled up by the Sovereign during that
period.</p>

<p>The patents for 1349, in the same way, occupy three
parts, or rolls. On the first part are enrolled the presentations
from January 25th to the end of May. This large
roll is a curiosity, since a very great part of the parchment
record is devoted to the entry of Royal presentations to the
vacant livings, no fewer than 249 being recorded, as
against 42 during the same period of the previous year.
The second part registers the livings filled by King Edward
from June to the middle of September, 1349, when the
number reaches the extraordinary figure of 440, as against
36 in the corresponding period of 1348.</p>

<p>The third period, ending on January 24th, 1350, shows a
decline in the number, although it still stands at the considerable
total of 205. Altogether, therefore, from January
25th, 1349, to the same date in 1350, the King alone presented
to 894 livings, which had become vacant. Comparing
the figures thus obtained with the normal period of 1348
it may be said roughly that out of the 1,053 presentations,
made by King Edward in the two years, at least 800 must
have been due to the mortality caused by the great plague.
This will be seen to be sufficiently terrible when it is
remembered that, even allowing for the large number of
presentations then in the hands of the King, they would
form but a very small portion of the total number of
institutions to vacant livings at this period.</p>

<p>The whole question of statistics in their details, as also
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p078"></a>[p078]</span> any special indications of the effects which followed upon
the ravages of the plague, will be dealt with in subsequent
chapters in order to interfere as little as possible with the
consecutive story of the visitation itself. Among the
presentations made by the King, in the autumn of this year,
frequent mention is made of vacancies in the diocese of
Sarum, in which the county of Dorset is situated. From
October 8th, 1348, to January 10th, 1349—that is, in
the space of three months—the Crown presented to no
fewer than 30 livings in the diocese. Most of these
were in the county of Dorset, and Abbotsbury Abbey,
apparently the first monastery attacked, and Bincombe
rectory, to which Edward III. presented on October 8th,
1348, were both close to Melcombe Regis, where the
plague commenced its ravages.</p>

<p>Judged merely by the few royal presentations it is
curious to observe how closely the epidemic in this country
clung to the rivers and water-courses. The neighbourhood
of Blandford, for instance, must have suffered severely
enough during the November and December of 1348, the two
Winterbournes and Spettisbury, together with Blandford—all
four close on the river Stour—losing their incumbents.
To Spettisbury, indeed, the King presented thrice in a very
short space of time. Even before John le Spencer, of
Grimsby, to whom the living was granted on December 7th,
could have been installed in his cure—in fact, probably
even before the grant was made—he was dead, for on
December 10th, only three days later, another letter patent
is issued, upon the death of Spencer, to Adam de Carleton.
Adam in his turn did not hold the benefice long, and on
January 4th, 1349, Robert de Hoveden was appointed in
his place. Nor are these the only instances, even among
the few presentations recorded on the patent rolls, of
Dorset incumbents following one another in rapid succession
during the last months of 1348.</p>

<p>Looking at the number of institutions in each month of
this period, and making due allowance for the fact that the
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p079"></a>[p079]</span> vacancy had probably occurred some little time before it
was filled up, it is evident that the epidemic was prevalent
in the county of Dorset from October, 1348, to February,
1349, and the mortality was highest in December and
January.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> The existence of the epidemic begins to be
manifest in the institutions for October, 1348. Previously
only twelve institutions are recorded during that year.
West Chickerell, a place close to Weymouth, received a
new incumbent on October 14th, whilst to Bincombe, close
by, which was then vacant, as is proved by the King's
presentation on the 8th of the month, no new incumbent
was inducted till November 4th. Warmwell and Combe
Kaynes, a little to the eastward, received new parish priests
on October the 9th and 19th, and Dorchester, the capital,
was attacked apparently about the same time.</p>

<p>Following the indications afforded by the Bishop's
registers the ravages of the pestilence are apparent on the
coast early in November, when many vacancies begin to be
noted in the coast towns. Bridport, East Lulworth,
Tynham, Langton, and Wareham had all been visited by
this time, whilst before the end of the month the epidemic
had crossed the county and appeared at Shaftesbury. On
December 3rd two vicarages in the south, quite close together,
Abbotsbury and Portesham, received new incumbents.</p>

<p>At Shaftesbury appointments were made to St. Laurence's
on the 29th of November, to St. Martin's on the 10th of
December, to St. John's on the 6th of January, 1349, and to
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p080"></a>[p080]</span> St. Laurence's again on the 12th of May. At Wareham,
the small alien priory became vacant before November
4th, for on that day the King appointed a successor to
Michael de Molis, lately dead,<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> and appointments were
made to St. Martin's, Wareham, on the 8th of December, to
St. Peter's on the 22nd of December, to St. John's on the
29th of May, and to St. Michael's on the 17th of June.
Three changes were registered as having taken place at
Winterbourne St. Nicholas, between December 27th and
May 3rd. As far as can be judged by the dates of these
institutions it would appear as if a fresh outbreak of peculiar
violence occurred towards the end of April.</p>

<p>The Bridport Corporation records show that four bailiffs
held office in 1349, in place of the usual two, on account of
the pestilence.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> In common with most places in the land,
Poole, which was then of sufficient importance to be called
upon to furnish four ships and 94 men for the siege of
Calais, suffered greatly from the pestilence, and received a
considerable check to its prosperity. "At Poole," writes
Hutchins, "a spot on the projecting slip of land, known as
the <em class="e000I2">Baiter</em>, is still pointed out as the burial-place of its
victims."<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> And the same writer adds that the country did
not entirely recover for the next 150 years; since, in the
reign of Henry VIII., "Poole and other towns in Dorsetshire"
were included in that numerous list of places whose
desolated buildings were ordered to be restored.</p>

<p>Before the close of the year 1348 the pestilence had
spread itself far and wide in the western counties of
England. The diocese of Bath and Wells, and that of
Exeter, the former conterminous with the county of Somerset,
and the latter comprising those of Devon and Cornwall,
were infected in the late autumn of that year, and all
over the west, as the old chronicle relates, the sickness
"most pitifully destroyed people innumerable."
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p081"></a>[p081]</span></p>

<p>Indeed, so terrible had been the effect of the scourge
among the clergy of Somerset that, as early as January
17th, 1349, the Bishop of Bath and Wells felt himself constrained
to address a letter of advice to his flock. The
document is of such interest, both as evidence of the straits
to which at that early date the diocese had been reduced
by the excessive mortality, and for the advice that it contains,
that it is here quoted at considerable length, since it
proves the depth of degradation to which the whole religious
life was reduced by the terror inspired by the disease.
Every bond was loosed, and every ordinary ecclesiastical
regulation and provision set aside, because none could now
be enforced, or, indeed, observed. "The contagious nature
of the present pestilence, which is ever spreading itself far
and wide," writes the Bishop, "has left many parish
churches and other cures, and consequently the people of
our diocese, destitute of curates<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> and priests. And inasmuch
as priests cannot be found who are willing out of
zeal, devotion, or for a stipend to undertake the care of the
foresaid places, and to visit the sick and administer to them
the Sacraments of the Church (perchance for dread of the
infection and contagion), many, as we understand, are dying
without the Sacrament of Penance. These, too, are ignorant
of what ought to be done in such necessity, and believe
that no confession of their sins, even in a case of such need,
is useful or meritorious, unless made to a priest having the
keys of the Church. Therefore, desiring, as we are bound
to do, the salvation of souls, and ever watching to bring
back the wandering from the crooked paths of error, we,
on the obedience you have sworn to us, urgently enjoin
upon you and command you—rectors, vicars, and parish
priests—in all your churches, and you deans, in such places
of your deaneries as are destitute of the consolation of
priests, that you at once and publicly instruct and induce,
yourselves or by some other, all who are sick of the present
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p082"></a>[p082]</span> malady, or who shall happen to be taken ill, that <em class="e000I2">in articulo
mortis</em>, if they are not able to obtain any priest, they
should make confession of their sins (according to the
teaching of the apostle) even to a layman, and, if a man is
not at hand, then to a woman. We exhort you, by the
present letters, in the bowels of Jesus Christ, to do this,
and to proclaim publicly in the aforesaid places that such
confession made to a layman in the presumed case can be
most salutary and profitable to them for the remission of
their sins, according to the teaching and the sacred canons
of the Church. And for fear any, imagining that these lay
confessors may make known confessions so made to them,
shall hesitate thus to confess in case of necessity, we make
known to all in general, and to those in particular who have
already heard these confessions, or who may in future hear
them, that they are bound by the precepts of the Church
to conceal and keep them secret; and that, by a decree of
the sacred canons, they are forbidden to betray such confession
by word, sign, and by any other means whatever,
unless those confessing so desire. And (further) should
they do otherwise, let such betrayers know that they sin
most gravely, and incur the indignation of Almighty God
and of the whole Church." And further to stir up the zeal
of both clergy and laity to this work the Bishop grants
ample indulgences to such as follow the advice here given
them.</p>

<p>"And since late repentance," he says "(when, for
example, sickness compels and the fear of punishment
terrifies) often deceives many, we grant to all our subjects,
who in the time of the pestilence shall come to confession
to priests having the keys of the Church and power
to bind and to loose, before they are taken sick, and who
do not delay till the day of necessity, forty days of indulgence.
To every priest also who shall induce people to do
this, and hear the confessions of those thus brought to confess
whilst in health, we grant the same by the mercy of
God Almighty, and trusting to the merits and prayers of
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p083"></a>[p083]</span> his glorious Mother, of the Blessed Peter, Paul, and
Andrew the Apostles, our patrons, and of all the
Saints."</p>

<p>"You shall further declare," he adds, "to all thus confessing
to lay people in case of necessity, that if they
recover they are bound to confess the same sins again to
their own parish priest. The Sacrament of the Eucharist,
when no priest can be obtained, may be administered by a
deacon. If, however, there be no priest to administer the
Sacrament of Extreme Unction, faith must, as in other
matters, suffice for the Sacrament."<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>These large derogations from the usual ecclesiastical
practice, though consonant alike with Christian charity and
the teaching of the Church, are resorted to only in cases of
the direst need, and the circular letter of the Bishop of
Bath and Wells witnesses to the extreme gravity of the
situation throughout the diocese, as early as the month of
January, 1349. Already, as is certain from the Bishop's
words, the dearth of clergy had made itself felt, and people
were dying in the county of Somerset without the possibility
of obtaining spiritual aid in their last hours, and no
priests could be found to take the places of those who had
already fallen victims to the disease. The list of institutions
given in the register of Bishop Ralph of Shrewsbury
shows that the mortality in that county was considerable
as early as the November of the previous year, 1348.</p>

<p>Taking the institutions of the diocese as a guide to the
time when the plague was most violent, and bearing in
mind that the death would have occurred some little time
before the institution, and that according to the Bishop's
letter some delay had been inevitable in the filling up of
benefices, the months when the pestilence was at its height
in the county of Somerset would appear to be December,
1348, and January and February, 1349, although the number
of institutions each month remains high until June. The
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p084"></a>[p084]</span> mortality was apparently highest about Christmastide,
1348.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>The Bishop of Bath and Wells remained at his manor of
Wiveliscombe till the worst was past in May of 1349.
Thither came the long procession of priests to receive their
letters of institution to vacant benefices. Day after day for
nearly six months the work went on with hardly any
cessation. Singly, or in twos and threes, often four and
five, once, at least, ten together, the clergy came to be instituted
to cures which the disease had left without a priest.</p>

<p>How the epidemic entered into the county, and the course
it pursued, it would be now impossible, even if it were
profitable, to discover. In December it would seem to have
gained a foothold in most parts of the county. It was at
Evercreech about November 19th, and about a fortnight
later at Castlecary and Almsford, in the same neighbourhood.
The fact that Bridgwater, Clevedon, Weston-super-mare,
Portishead, and Bristol were amongst the earliest
places in the county to be attacked would almost make it
appear that the contagion was carried to these coast towns
by a boat passing up the Bristol Channel. This supposition,
moreover, is somewhat confirmed, as will be seen subsequently,
by the fact that the towns of North Devon were
attacked by the disease almost simultaneously with those
on the south coast, and very much about the same time as
those of North Somerset.</p>

<p>Bath suffered under the scourge in the early part of
January, 1349. On the 9th and 10th of that month several
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p085"></a>[p085]</span> institutions to livings, either in the city or the neighbourhood,
being recorded. In the same month it had spread to
the abbey of Keynsham, on the road between Bath and
Bristol, and its path can almost be traced along the line of
communication between Bath and Wells. Thus the villages
of Freshford, Twerton, Hardington, Holcombe, Cloford,
Kilmersdon, Babington, Compton, and Doulting, as well as
several benefices in Wells itself, all fell vacant at this time.</p>

<p>It may be said with considerable certainty that fully half
the number of beneficed clergy fell victims to the disease in
this diocese. Many livings were rendered vacant two and
three times during its course; whilst a not inconsiderable
number had four changes of incumbents within these few
months. Bathampton, for example, had four parsons appointed
in this period. At Hardington, not far from
Frome, from January, 1349, to the middle of March, there
were certainly three and perhaps four changes due to the
disease; and at Yeovil, from the 15th December, 1348, to
the 4th February, 1349, three priests held the living, one
after the other.</p>

<p>Little or no information is forthcoming as to the religious
houses of the county at this time. Both Athelney and
Muchelney lost their abbots, and probably also many of
their members. The fact that the great abbey of Glastonbury,
which previously contained within its walls a community
of some 80 monks, is found in <em class="e0U003">A.D.</em> 1377 to have
44, seems to indicate that it must have suffered very severe
losses through the epidemic.</p>

<p>At Bath, in 1344, only five years before the outbreak of
the disease, the community at the Priory consisted of
thirty professed monks under Prior John de Ford.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> A list
on the roll of the Somerset clergy, on whom a clerical subsidy
was levied at the close of Edward the Third's reign,
in 1377, shows that the number had been reduced to sixteen,<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p086"></a>[p086]</span> and at this number it apparently remained to the time
of the final dissolution of the house in the sixteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>It is not difficult to understand that the plague must have
raged with great virulence in the larger cities, where in
those days the most elementary notions of sanitation were
almost unknown. In the west, Bristol, of course, suffered
severely. "There," says the sub-contemporary writer,
Knighton, "died, suddenly overwhelmed by death, almost
the whole strength of the town, for few were sick more
than three days, or two days, or even half a day." Nor
need this be a subject of wonder when, according to the
description of a modern writer, speaking of the city at this
very period, the streets were very narrow; in the busier
parts the ground was honeycombed with cellars for storing
wine, salt, and other merchandise, whilst refuse streamed
down the centre ditch. So small was the distance between
the houses that no vehicle was allowed to be used in the
streets, and all goods were carried on pack-horses or
porters, a custom which even in the 17th century excited
the wonder of Samuel Pepys.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>"Here in Bristol," says the local historian Seyer, quoting
an old calendar of the town, "in 1348 the plague raged to
such a degree that the living were scarce able to bury the
dead. The Gloucestershire men would not suffer the
Bristol men to have access to them. At last it reached
Gloucester, Oxford, and London; scarce the tenth person
was left alive, male or female. At this period the grass
grew several inches high in High Street and Broad Street;
it raged at first chiefly in the centre of the city. This
pestilence came from abroad, and the people near the sea-coast
in Dorsetshire and Devonshire were first affected."<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
By the wholesale destruction of the population of this
western port the same authority accounts for the reduction
of the King's taxation of the city from £245 to £158.
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p087"></a>[p087]</span></p>

<p>Lastly, in Bristol, as indeed without doubt in most places,
the cemeteries did not long suffice for the multitude of the
dead. Of this there is an example upon the Patent Rolls.
The parson of Holy Cross de la Temple soon found the
necessity of enlarging his graveyard. For this purpose he
obtained half-an-acre adjoining the old cemetery, and so
great and pressing was the need of this fresh accommodation
that it was done without the required royal license,
for which subsequently a pardon had to be sued from the
King.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>The diocese of Exeter, comprising the two counties of
Devon and Cornwall, was stricken by the disease apparently
about the same time as the county of Somerset.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> For
eight years before 1348 the average number of livings
annually rendered vacant in the diocese was thirty-six,<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
whilst in the single month of January 1349, the Bishop instituted
to some thirty livings, which shows that death had
already been busy among the clergy.</p>

<p>The number of institutions in each month of the year
points to the conclusion that the disease lingered somewhat
longer in these counties than elsewhere. It is not till the
close of September that any great decrease in the number
of vacancies is seen, and although probably beginning in
December, the height of the plague was not reached till
March, April, and May.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p088"></a>[p088]</span></p>

<p>Prebendary Hingeston-Randolph thus describes the state
of the Exeter episcopal registers at this period:—"There
is very little direct information about the Black Death in
Bishop Grandisson's register; but there is a great deal of
indirect information. The <em class="e000I2">Registrum Commune</em>, which
is wonderfully full before and after the fatal year, records
scarcely anything during the year itself. The ordinary
work of the diocese seems to have been all suspended,
with a single exception. The register of institutions—a
separate volume—is a record of incessant and most
distressing work. Its very outward aspect for this
period tells a tale of woe. The entries are made
hurriedly and roughly, in striking contrast with the neatness
and regularity of the rest of the Register. They
are no longer grouped, as before, in years, but in months,
and the changes in each month exceed the changes of a
whole ordinary year, when there was no pestilence. The
scribe leaves off the customary 'vacant <em class="e000I2">per mortem</em>,' as
if he dreaded to write the fatal word. The clergy must
have fallen by wholesale; evidently they were faithful, and,
for their flocks' sake, faced the foe without flinching. And,
as each of them fell, another was ready at his Bishop's call
fearlessly to fill the vacant place. Some incumbencies
lasted but a few weeks. And, when all was over, the survivors
were, comparatively, so few that there was no small
difficulty in filling many a subsequent vacant benefice; this
result of the sickness is to be traced for some time after
the mortality had ceased.</p>

<p>"The Bishop never left his diocese, and the continuous
presence of so strong, so earnest, and devoted a prelate
must have been an unspeakable consolation and help to
his grievously afflicted flock."</p>

<p>An examination of the institutions of the diocese, in relation
to the time when the plague visited the various parts
of it, appears to show that it commenced almost simultaneously
in both north and south. In North Devon it is
found at both Northam and Alverdiscott on the 7th of
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p089"></a>[p089]</span> November, at Fremington in the same district on the 8th,
and at Barnstaple on December the 23rd. It is found in
November at villages on the Exe, and had possibly also
reached Exeter before the close of the month. In the
South, the fact of the close proximity of the part first
infected to Dorsetshire explains the course of the epidemic;
but the early outbreak in the coast villages at the mouth
of the estuary leading to Barnstaple points to the conclusion
that the infection was brought by a ship passing up
the Bristol Channel, which subsequently infected other
towns further up on the Somerset shore of the passage.</p>

<p>It is of interest also to note how greatly the coast towns
generally appear to have suffered, as the contagion was very
probably carried from one place to another by the fishing
boats. Up some of the estuaries it would seem as if the
passage of the disease could be traced by the dates of the
institutions. Thus, to take one example, in March, 1349,
there is an institution to a living at the mouth of the
Fowey in Cornwall; a week later there is another at
St. Winnow's Vicarage higher up, and on March 22nd the
sickness had reached Bodmin, at no great distance from
the river, and a place with which, in all probability, the
passage up the estuary of the Fowey would be an ordinary
and usual means of communication.</p>

<p>As to the result of the sickness in the religious houses
of the diocese some few details are known. At St.
Nicholas', Exeter, the Prior died in March, 1349; his
successor, John de Wye, was admitted on the 26th of that
month, but died almost immediately. The next Prior was
not installed until June 7th, and the house was found to be in
a deplorable state.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> So also at Pilton Priory two superiors
died within a few weeks one of the other. At the alien
priory of Minster, Cornwall, William de Huma, the Prior,
was carried off by the sickness on 26th of April, 1349, and
the house was so impoverished by the death of tenants
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p090"></a>[p090]</span> and labourers that it could not support both its members,
and the chaplain they were bound to find to do the parish
work, as neither the prior nor his brethren spoke English,
"or rather Cornish."<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>At the Cistercian abbey of Newenham the register
records that "in the time of this mortality or pestilence
there died in this house twenty monks and three lay-brothers,
whose names are entered in other books. And
Walter, the abbot, and two monks were left alive there
after the sickness."<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>At the Augustinian abbey of Hartland, Roger de
Raleghe, the abbot, died, and the proclamation of the
election of his successor is dated 18th March, 1349. At
Benedictine Tavistock also the abbot died, and his successor,
Richard de Esse, was taken ill after his confirmation,
and, "detained by so grave a sickness," could not go
to the King, who, on October 17th, commissioned Bishop
Grandisson to receive his fealty.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>At Bodmin, according to a note taken by William of
Worcester from a register in the Church of the Friars
Minor there, it was estimated that 1,500 persons died of
this sickness.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> Amongst these was the Vicar, whose successor
was appointed on April 8th, 1349. The Augustinian
priory in the town was almost depopulated. The prior,
John de Kilkhampton, and all his brethren but two were
carried off by the sickness. The two survivors, on March
17th, wrote to the Bishop saying that they "were left like
orphans," and begging that he would provide a superior
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p091"></a>[p091]</span> for their house at once. The next day, March the 18th,
1349, an inquisition was held under a writ of the Prince of
Wales. The jury found that the priory was free, and that
the last prior had died "on Friday, next after the feast of
St. Peter in Cathedra then last past" (February 27th).<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>On March 19th Bishop Grandisson wrote to the prior of
Launceston setting forth the facts, and appointing a member
of that house to the office. Three days later the mandate
for his induction was issued, in the hopes that "by his
careful watchfulness the said priory may recover from the
calamity."<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>The plight to which the Augustinians of Bodmin were
reduced by the disease is, after all, typical of that of many
religious houses throughout the country. Meantime, however,
the epidemic had not confined its ravages to the
western counties, but continued to spread the same desolation
in every direction, as the wave of pestilence rolled
onward over the length and breadth of the land.</p>

<h2 title="Chapter VI. Progress of the Disease in London and the South.">
<a id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.
<span class="smaller">PROGRESS OF THE DISEASE IN LONDON
AND THE SOUTH.</span></h2>

<p class="chap-first">For a time the people of Gloucester strove, but in vain,
to protect their city by prohibiting all intercourse with
plague-stricken Bristol. The contagion passed from one
district to another, from town to town, and village to village,
soon involving the entire land in one common misfortune.
"There was no city, nor town, nor hamlet, nor even, save
in rare instances, any house," writes an English contemporary,
"in which this plague did not carry off the
whole, or the greater portion, of the inhabitants." And so
great was the destruction of life "that the living scarcely
sufficed to tend the sick and bury the dead."&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. In
some places, on account of the deficiency of cemeteries,
the Bishop consecrated new burial grounds.</p>

<p>"In that time there was sold a quarter of wheat for 12d.,
a quarter of barley for 9d., a quarter of beans for 8d., a
quarter of oats for 6d., a large ox for 40d., a good horse
for six shillings, which formerly was worth 40 shillings, a
good cow for two shillings, and even for eighteen-pence.
And even at this price buyers were only rarely to be found.
And this pestilence lasted for two years and more before
England was freed from it."</p>

<p>"When, by God's mercy it ceased, there was such a
scarcity of labourers that none could be had for agricultural
purposes. On account of this scarcity, women, and even
small children, were to be seen with the plough and leading
the waggons."<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>The rapidity with which the contagion spread from place
to place makes it now impossible to follow its course with
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p093"></a>[p093]</span> any certainty; the more so because it seems likely that
many towns on the southern and western coasts became
fresh starting points for the disease. London, in constant
communication with other ports, is said by one contemporary
to have been attacked as early as September 29th,
1348,<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> whilst other authorities fix, at latest, All Saints' day—November
1st—as the date when the epidemic declared
itself in London. It lasted in the city and its neighbourhood
till about the feast of Pentecost next following, and according
to the contemporary Robert of Avesbury, it was most
severe in the two months from February 2nd to Easter.
During the time, he says, "almost every day there were
buried in the new cemetery, then made at Smithfield, more
than 200 bodies of the dead, over and above those buried
in other cemeteries of the city."<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>Parliament, which was to have assembled at Westminster
in January, 1349, was at the beginning of the month prorogued,
because, as the King says, "the plague of deadly
pestilence had suddenly broken out in the said place and
the neighbourhood, and daily increased in severity so that
grave fears were entertained for the safety of those coming
there at that time."<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> The churchyards of the city were
quickly found to be insufficient, and two, if not three,
cemeteries were opened. Of the one in Smithfield referred
to in the quotation already given from Robert of Avesbury,
the historian Stowe gives the following account:—"In the
year 1348 (23 Edward III.) the first great pestilence in his
time began, and increased so sore that from want of room
in churchyards to bury the dead of the city and of the
suburbs, one John Corey, clerk, procured of Nicholas, prior
of the Holy Trinity within Aldgate, one toft of ground near
unto East Smithfield for the burial of them that died, with
condition that it might be called 'the churchyard of the
Holy Trinity;' which ground he caused, by the aid of
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p094"></a>[p094]</span> divers devout citizens, to be enclosed with a wall of stone.
Robert Elsing, son of William Elsing, gave five pounds
thereunto; and the same was dedicated by Ralph Stratford,
Bishop of London, where innumerable bodies of the dead
were afterwards buried, and a chapel built in the same
place, to the honour of God." Subsequently Edward III.
founded there a monastery of Cistercian monks dedicated
to our Lady of Graces.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>The same author also relates the establishment of the
better-known new cemetery, where subsequently the
Charterhouse was founded. "The churchyards," he writes
of this time, "were not sufficient to receive the dead, but
men were forced to choose out certain fields for burials.
Whereupon Ralph Stratford, Bishop of London, in the year
1348, bought a piece of ground, called 'No man's land,'
which he enclosed with a wall of brick and dedicated for
the burial of the dead, building thereupon a proper chapel,
which is now (<em class="e000I2">i.e.</em>, 1598) enlarged and made a dwelling-house;
and this burying plot is become a fair garden,
retaining the old name of 'Pardon Churchyard.'</p>

<p>"After this, in the year 1349, the said Sir Walter Manny,
in respect of the danger that might befal in this time of so
great a plague and infection, purchased thirteen acres and
a rood of ground, adjoining to the said 'No man's land,'
and lying in a place called 'Spittle Croft,' because it belonged
to St. Bartholomew's Hospital (since that called
'New Church Haw'), and caused it to be consecrated by
the said Bishop of London to the use of burials.</p>

<p>"In this plot of ground there were (in that year) more
than 50,000 persons buried, as I have read in the Charters
of Edward the Third.</p>

<p>"Also I have seen and read an inscription, fixed on a
stone cross sometime standing in the same churchyard, and
having these words: <em class="e000I2">Anno Domini 1349.</em> <em class="e000I2">Regnante</em>, &#38;c.
That is in English, 'A great plague raging in the year of
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p095"></a>[p095]</span> our Lord 1349, this churchyard was consecrated; wherein,
and within the bounds of the present monastery, were
buried more than 50,000 bodies of the dead, besides many
others from thence to the present time, whose souls God
have mercy upon. Amen."<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>Whilst it is perfectly possible, and even probable, that
the number 50,000, named by Stowe as buried in one
churchyard, is an exaggerated estimate, it is on the other
hand more than likely that the pestilence found the sanitary
condition of the London of that period very favourable for
its rapid development. The narrow and ill-cleansed streets,
the low, unventilated and undrained houses, and the general
condition of living at the time would all favour the growth
of so contagious a disease as that which visited the city in
the middle of the fourteenth century. One slight glimpse of
the state of the streets about this time is afforded in a document
issued by the King to the Mayor and Sheriffs, when
in 1361 a second visitation threatened to become as destructive
to human life as that of 1349. "Because," says
the royal letter, "by the killing of great beasts, from
whose putrid blood running down the streets and the
bowels cast into the Thames, the air in the city is very
much corrupted and infected, whence abominable and most
filthy stench proceeds, sickness and many other evils have
happened to such as have abode in the said city, or have
resorted to it; and great dangers are feared to fall out for
the time to come, unless remedy be presently made against
it; we, willing to prevent such dangers, ordain, by consent
of the present Parliament, that all 'bulls, oxen, hogs, and
other gross creatures' be killed at either Stratford or
Knightsbridge."<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p096"></a>[p096]</span></p>

<p>There are indeed many indications that the number of
those who died in the city was very great.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> The extraordinary
increase in the number of wills proved in the
"Court of Hustings" affords some indication of this.
During the three previous years the average number in that
Court was twenty-two. In 1349 they reached the number
of 222; and the wills themselves afford further evidence of
the rapidity with which members of the same family
followed each other to the grave. In one instance a son,
who was appointed executor to his father's will, died before
probate could be obtained, and his own will was passed
through the Court together with that of his father.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> The
number of probates granted in each month is some indication
of the time when the mortality was highest. May,
with a total of 121, and July, with 51, are the largest
numbers, whilst it is curious to observe that the large
number in May is accounted for by the fact that none were
proved in April.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> It may be surmised that this was
brought about by the complete paralysis of all business
about the month of April in consequence of the sickness;
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p097"></a>[p097]</span> this view being strengthened by the fact that no Easter
sittings of the Courts of Justices were held.</p>

<p>Westminster was grievously visited by the sickness. On
March 10th, 1349, in proroguing the Parliament for the
second time, the King declared that the plague had
increased in Westminster and London more seriously than
ever.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> Some weeks later the great monastery was
attacked; early in May abbot Bircheston died, and at the
same time 27 of his monks were committed to a common
grave in the southern walk of the cloister. To relieve the
urgent necessities of the house and those about it jewels
and other ornaments to the value of £315 13s. 8d.—a large
sum in those days—were sold during the visitation out of
the monastic treasury.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>At Westminster, too, the Hospital of St. James was left
without inmates. "The then guardian and all the other
brethren and sisters, except one," had died; and in May,
1349, William de Weston, the survivor, was appointed
guardian. Charged with dilapidation, he was deposed in
1351, but in 1353 the house still remained without inmates.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>What happened at St. Albans has been recorded by
Walsingham in the <em class="e000I2">Gesta Abbatum</em>. Speaking of abbot
Michael Mentmore, he writes: "The pestilence, which
carried off well-nigh half of all mankind, coming to St.
Albans he was struck by a premature death, being touched
by the common misery amongst the first of his monks,
who were carried off by the deadly disease. And although
on Maundy Thursday (<em class="e000I2">i.e.</em>, Thursday in Holy Week) he
felt the beginning of the ailment, still out of devotion to
the feast, and in memory of our Lord's humility, he celebrated
solemnly the High Mass, and after that, before
dinner, humbly and reverently washed the feet of the poor.
Then, after partaking of food, he washed and kissed the
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p098"></a>[p098]</span> feet of all the brethren. And all the offices of that day he
performed alone and without assistance.</p>

<p>"On the morrow, the sickness increasing, he betook himself
to bed, and like a true catholic, having made, with contrite
heart, a sincere confession, he received the Sacrament
of Extreme Unction. And so in sorrow and sadness he
lasted till noon of Easter-Day.</p>

<p>"And because the plague was then raging, and the air
was corrupt, and the monks were dying day by day," he
was buried as quickly as possible. "And there died at that
time, forty-seven monks" over and above those who were
carried off in great numbers, in (the monasteries which
are) the cells (of St. Albans)."<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>In another place the same writer adds: "By God's permission
came the pestilence which swept away such
numbers. Amongst the abbots was Dom Michael of pious
memory, abbot of St. Albans. At that same time the
prior of the monastery, Nicholas, and the sub-prior of the
place also died. By the advice, therefore, of those learned
in the law the convent chose Dom Thomas de Risburgh,
professor of Holy Scripture, as prior of the Monastery."<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p>From the date of the death of the abbot of St. Albans,
on April the 12th, 1349, it would appear that the epidemic
was then at its height in that part of Hertfordshire. The
institutions for the portion of the county in the diocese of
Lincoln, however, show that it must have lingered on, at
any rate in the northern part, till the late summer.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>"In Hertfordshire Manors," writes Mr. Thorold Rogers,
"where it (<em class="e000I2">i.e.</em>, the great plague of 1349) was specially
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p099"></a>[p099]</span> destructive, it was the practice, for thirty years, to head the
schedule of expenditure with an enumeration of the lives
which were lost and the tenancies which were vacated after
1348."<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>The neighbouring counties of Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire,
and Berkshire suffered in the same way. Although
the chronicles make no special mention of the ravages of
the epidemic in them, it would, indeed, from other sources
of information, appear that during the first half of 1349
the mortality in this district was as great as in most other
parts of the country. Thus, the general state of the
country after the plague had passed may be illustrated
from a class of documents known as <em class="e000I2">Inquisitiones post
mortem</em>. Theoretically, at least, the whole country belonged
to the Sovereign; the actual possessors holding as tenants
of the Crown, just as the smaller farmers and peasants held
from the tenant <em class="e000I2">in capite</em>. On the death of landowners,
therefore, the Crown exercised certain rights and claimed
certain dues, which it levied on the estates, the King's
officers holding them until the rights of the Sovereign over
the in-coming heir were satisfied. To secure these in
each county, an official was appointed known as the
Escheator, whose duty it was on the death of any landowner,
in response to the King's writ, to summon a jury
bound by oath to inquire into, and testify to, the extent
and value of the land held by the deceased person. The
record of their sworn verdict is known as the <em class="e000I2">Inquisitio
post mortem</em>.</p>

<p>These returns made into the King's Court of Chancery,
even as they now exist—many of them having been lost,
or having otherwise disappeared—show a great increase in
number in the year 1349. The average number of these
inquisitions for the two years 1346 and 1347 is less than
120; in 1348 there are 130, whilst in 1349 there still exist
311 such records. That the number was very considerably
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p100"></a>[p100]</span> more than this appears from the entry of the writs to
the various Escheators upon the "Originalia Roll" for
1349. From this source it may be gathered that the number
of writs issued by the King upon information of the death
of landed proprietors was 619. Sometimes several such
writs are addressed at one time to the Escheator to inquire
into many deaths in the same place.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>These records afford evidence of the numbers of landowners
swept off by the scourge, but their special value
lies in the testimony they afford to the state of various
manors and holdings examined in regard to their value
after the plague had abated. The smaller tenants paying
rent or performing land services were, of course, the chief
element in the value of an estate, and especially where
the land was in common, as was generally the case, empty
farmsteads and cottages meant a proportional decrease in
the yearly value.</p>

<p>Thus, to take some examples of the evidence of the
epidemic in this district. Of the manor of Sladen in
Buckinghamshire, not far from Berkhampstead, a jury,
about the beginning of August, 1349, declared upon oath
that the mill was of no value, since the miller was dead
and there were no tenants left to want any corn ground,
"because of the mortality." The rents derived hitherto
from the free tenants, natives of the soil and cottagers,
had been £12 a year, now it is declared that there are no
tenants at all, and that the land is lying untilled and useless.
On the whole manor one little cottage, with a strip of land,
held by one John Robyns on a service rent worth seven
shillings a year, was apparently all that was considered to
be worth anything. At another place on the same estate
all the tenants and cottars except one were dead, and at a
third not one had survived.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p><span class="xxpn"><a id="p101"></a>[p101]</span> In Bedfordshire, by the end of May, 1349, the same tale
is told. A cloth mill on the manor of Storington is said
to be idle and worthless, and the reason assigned is that
"it stands empty through the mortality of the plague, and
there is no one who wishes to use it or rent it for the same
reason." Land, too, is described as lying uncultivated,
and woods cannot be sold because there is no one to
buy.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>In Berkshire, in July, 1349, on a manor belonging to the
Husee family the rents and services of the natives of the
soil, "now dead," which were formerly worth thirty-two
shillings a year, are declared to be without any value at
all, because, as the Inquisition says, "there is no one
willing to buy or to hire the land of the said dead tenants,"
and since the land lay all in common it could not be cultivated,
and was thus useless.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> In the same way, on the
manor of Crokham, which had belonged to Catherine,
wife of the Earl of Salisbury, even as early as April 23rd
of this year the free tenants and other holders, who had
paid yearly £13, were all dead, and no tenants could be
got to take up their lands.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> In other places there are
no Court fees, no services performed, and no mills used,
because all on the land are dead; houses and tenements
also are in hand, and rents everywhere are either
reduced or are nothing at all, because some or all of those
who held the lands and cottages have been swept away.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>The institutions for the county of Buckingham show that
in the year 1349<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> there were eighty-three appointments
made to vacant livings. This is slightly less than half the
total number of benefices in the county, which appears to
have been 180. From the appointments that are dated it
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p102"></a>[p102]</span> appears probable that the sickness was at its worst in the
county in the months from May till September, 1349.<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>On the other side of London, the dioceses of Canterbury
and Rochester divide between them the county of Kent.
The Archbishop had jurisdiction over the south-eastern
portion with its long line of coast stretching from the
Medway to the boundaries of Sussex. The diocese of
Rochester included the western portion of Kent, which
lies on the southern bank of the Thames from London to
Sheerness. The diocese of Canterbury was in many
respects peculiarly exposed to the chances of contagion.
In it were situated both Dover and Sandwich, the two chief
points of communication with the ports of France, and
through the city of Canterbury passed the main line of
road between the coast and London.</p>

<p>Thrice, within a few months, the Archiepiscopal See was
deprived by death of its ruler; and one, at least, of these,
and very probably two, died of the prevailing sickness.
The register of the prior and convent of Christchurch,
Canterbury, during the vacancy, shows that institutions
to livings in the diocese followed one another in rapid succession,
and that deaths must have occurred in a large
proportion of the benefices of this part of England.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> "In
the year of our Lord, 1348, immediately after the close of
the Nativity," writes Stephen Birchington, in his history
of the Archbishops of Canterbury, "arrived the common
death of all people; and it lasted continuously till the end
of the month of May, in the year 1349. By this pestilence
barely a third part of mankind were left alive. Then, also,
there was such a scarcity and dearth of priests that the
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p103"></a>[p103]</span> parish churches remained almost unserved, and beneficed
persons, through fear of death, left the care of the benefices,
not knowing where to go."<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>At Canterbury itself there is some evidence of the
epidemic. The abbot of St. Augustine's had died of the
disease at Avignon; but no information has been preserved
of what took place at the monastery itself, although the
fact that abbot Thomas asked for and obtained from Pope
Clement VI dispensations, "on account of defect of birth,"
for six monks, whom he desired to have ordained at this
time, makes it more than probable that the pestilence had
carried off many members of the community, whose places
it was necessary to fill.</p>

<p>At Christchurch only four of the community died at the
time, and this comparative immunity has been ascribed to
the excellent water supply obtained a century before for
the monastery from the hills.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> Later on in the summer,
however, when the new abbot of St. Albans rested at
Canterbury, on his way to the Pope at Avignon, one of the
two companions whom he had with him died of the sickness
there.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> In the city, also, two masters were appointed
to the Hospital of Eastbridge, one quickly after the other.
The prioress of St. Sepulchre's and the prior of St.
Gregory's both died; but we can only suspect what happened
in the communities at this anxious time, and among the
people at large. At Sandwich, in the June of 1349, the
plague was still raging. The old cemetery was full to
overflowing, and the suffragan bishop was commissioned
to proceed thither and consecrate a new piece of ground,
given for the purpose by the Earl of Huntingdon.<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>One example may be given here of the rapidity with
which during the great sickness members of a family
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p104"></a>[p104]</span> followed one another to the grave. Sir Thomas Dene, of
Ospring, about three miles from Faversham, in the northern
part of the diocese of Rochester, died on May the 18th,
1349. At the time of his death he had four daughters—Benedicta,
five years old, Margaret, four years, and Martha
and Joan, younger still. By July the 8th Martha, the wife
of Sir Thomas, had also died, and from the inquisition, taken
on Monday, the 3rd of August, 1349, it appears that of the
children the two youngest were now also dead. Thus, out
of a family of six, the father, mother, and two children had
been carried off by the disease.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>In this second half of the county of Kent, which forms the
diocese of Rochester, the sickness was felt as severely as
in the Canterbury diocese. What happened here is
told in the account of William Dene, a monk of Rochester,
and a contemporary of the events he describes. "A plague
such as never before had been heard of," he writes,
"ravaged England in this year. The Bishop of Rochester
out of his small household lost four priests, five gentlemen,
ten serving men, seven young clerks, and six pages, so that
not a soul remained who might serve him in any office. At
Malling (a Benedictine nunnery) he blessed two abbesses,
and both quickly died, and there were left there only four
professed nuns and four novices. To one of these the
Bishop committed the charge of the temporals, to another
that of the spirituals, because no proper person for abbess
could be found."</p>

<p>"The whole of this time," says the writer in another
place, "the Bishop of Rochester remained at Halling<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> and
Trotterscliff,<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> and he conferred orders in both places at certain
intervals. Alas, for our sorrow! this mortality swept
away so vast a multitude of both sexes that none could be
found to carry the corpses to the grave. Men and women
bore their own offspring on their shoulders to the church
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p105"></a>[p105]</span> and cast them into a common pit. From these there proceeded
so great a stench that hardly anyone dared to
cross the cemeteries."</p>

<p>The chronicler calls attention, in the most distinct terms,
to a fact mentioned by Birchington of Canterbury, and
touched on by the Bishop of Bath and Wells
(<a href="#p081">p. 81</a>),
namely, that dread of the contagion interfered even with
the exercise of priestly functions. These are, perhaps, the
only cases in England which recall the terrible and uncontrollable
fear which in Italy issued in an abandonment
of all principle.</p>

<p>Again, he says: "In this pestilence many chaplains and
paid clerics refused to serve, except at excessive salaries.
The Bishop of Rochester, by a mandate addressed to the
archdeacon of Rochester, on the 27th of June, 1349,
orders all these, on pain of suspension, to serve such
cures;"<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> "and some priests and clerics refuse livings, now
vacant in law and fact," writes the Bishop, "because they
are slenderly provided for; and some, having poor livings,
which they had long ago obtained, are now unwilling to
keep them, because their stipend, on account of the death
of their parishioners, is so notoriously diminished that they
cannot get a living and bear the burden of their cure.
It has accordingly happened that parishes have remained
unserved for a long time, and the cure attached to them has
been abandoned to the great danger of souls. We, desiring
to remedy this as soon as possible, by the present letters permit
and grant special leave to all rectors and vicars of our
city and diocese instituted, or hereafter to be instituted, to
such slender benefices as do not produce a true revenue of
ten marks sterling a year, to receive during their poverty
an anniversary mass, or such a number of masses as may
bring their stipends to this annual sum."<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p106"></a>[p106]</span></p>

<p>Then after noting that the Archbishop of Canterbury,
Thomas Bradwardine, had died in the Bishop of Rochester's
palace in London, William Dene continues: "So great was
the deficiency of labourers and workmen of every kind in
those days that more than a third of the land over the
whole kingdom remained uncultivated. The labourers and
skilled workmen were imbued with such a spirit of rebellion
that neither king, law, nor justice could curb them. The
whole people for the greater part ever became more
depraved, more prone to every vice, and more inclined than
before to evil and wickedness, not thinking of death, nor
of the past plague, nor of their own salvation.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. And
priests, little weighing the sacrifice of a contrite spirit,
betook themselves to places where they could get larger
stipends than in their own benefices. On which account
many benefices remained unserved, whose holders would
not be stayed by the rule of their Ordinary. Thus, day by
day, the dangers to soul both in clergy and in people
multiplied."</p>

<p>"Throughout the whole of that winter and spring the
Bishop of Rochester, an old and decrepid man, remained
at Trotterscliff, saddened and grieving over the sudden
change of the age. And in every manor of the Bishopric
buildings and walls fell to ruins, and that year there was
hardly a manor which returned a hundred pounds. In the
monastery of Rochester, also, there was such a scarcity of
provisions that the community were troubled with great
want of food; so much so that the monks were obliged to
grind their own bread." The prior, however, adds the
writer, always lived well. William Dene also relates much
that will come under consideration when the results of the
great pestilence are dealt with. Here, however, it may be
noted that he speaks of "the Bishop visiting the abbey of
Malling and the monastery of Lesnes," when he found
them so poor "that, as is thought, from the present age to
the Day of Judgment they can never recover." Moreover,
he notes that Simon Islep, on the day of his enthronisation
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p107"></a>[p107]</span> as Archbishop of Canterbury, did not keep the feast, as was
usual, with great display, but to avoid all expense kept it
simply with the monks in their refectory at Christchurch.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>To this account of the state of the diocese of Rochester,
written at the time, it is only necessary to add that the
number of benefices in this portion of Kent was some 230,
which will serve as some indication of the number of
clergy carried off by the prevailing sickness.</p>

<p>The diocese of Winchester includes the two counties of
Surrey and Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. On the 24th
of October, 1348, Bishop Edyndon, the occupant of the
see, addressed a letter to his clergy ordering prayers.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> It
bears upon it the stamp of the horror which had seized
upon the minds of all by reason of the reports now
coming to hand of what had taken place in other countries.
"William, by Divine providence, Bishop," he writes, "to
the prior and chapter of our Church of Winchester, health,
grace, and benediction. A voice in Rama has been heard;
much weeping and crying has sounded throughout the
various countries of the globe. Nations, deprived of their
children in the abyss of an unheard plague, refuse to be
consoled because, as is terrible to hear of, cities, towns,
castles, and villages, adorned with noble and handsome
buildings, and wont up to the present to rejoice in an
illustrious people, in their wisdom and counsel, in their
strength, and in the beauty of their matrons and virgins;
wherein, too, every joy abounded, and whither multitudes
of people flocked from afar for relief; all these
have already been stripped of their population by the
calamity of the said pestilence, more cruel than any
two-edged sword. And into these said places now none
dare enter, but fly far from them as from the dens of
wild beasts. Every joy has ceased in them; pleasant
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p108"></a>[p108]</span> sounds are hushed, and every note of gladness is banished.
They have become abodes of horror and a very wilderness;
fruitful country places, without the tillers, thus carried off,
are deserts and abandoned to barrenness. And, news most
grave which we report with the deepest anxiety, this cruel
plague, as we have heard, has already begun to singularly
afflict the various coasts of the realm of England. We
are struck with the greatest fear lest, which God forbid,
the fell disease ravage any part of our city and
diocese. And although God, to prove our patience, and
justly to punish our sins, often afflicts us, it is not in
man's power to judge the Divine counsels. Still, it is much
to be feared that man's sensuality, which, propagated
by the tendency of the old sin of Adam, from youth inclines
all to evil, has now fallen into deeper malice and
justly provoked the Divine wrath by a multitude of sins
to this chastisement.</p>

<p>"But because God is loving and merciful, patient, and
above all hatred, we earnestly beg that by your devotion
He may ward off from us the scourge we have so justly
deserved, if we now turn to Him humbly with our whole
heart. We exhort you in the Lord, and in virtue of obedience
we strictly enjoin you to come before the face of God,
with contrition and confession of all your sins, together
with the consequent due satisfaction through the efficacious
works of salutary penance. We order further that every
Sunday and Wednesday all of you, assembled together in
the choir of your monastery, say the seven Penitential
psalms, and the fifteen gradual psalms, on your
knees, humbly and devoutly. Also on every Friday,
together with these Psalms, we direct that you
chant the long litany, instituted against pestilences of
this kind by the holy Fathers, through the market-place
of our city of Winchester, walking in procession, together
with the clergy and people of the said city. We desire
that all should be summoned to these solemn processions
and urged to make use of other devout exercises, and
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p109"></a>[p109]</span> directed to follow these processions in such a way that
during their course they walk with heads bent down,
with feet bare, and fasting; whilst with pious hearts
they repeat their prayers and, putting away vain conversation,
say, as often as possible, the Lord's Prayer and Hail
Mary. Also that they should remain in earnest prayer to
the close of the Mass, which at the end of the procession we
desire you to celebrate in your church." The Bishop then
concludes by granting indulgences to those who approach
the Sacrament of Confession, and shall in these public
devotions pray that God "may cause the severity of the
plague to be stayed."<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>On the same day, October 24th, 1348, Bishop Edyndon
issued other mandates to his clergy generally, and to the
archdeacon of Surrey in particular. He charges them to
see that, in view of the terrible plague which was approaching,
all are exhorted to frequent the Sacrament of Penance
and to join in the public prayers and processions to be
made with bare feet in towns through the market-places,
and in villages in the cemeteries round about the
churches.</p>

<p>On November 17th, on the nearer approach of the
epidemic, the Bishop granted faculties to absolve from all
reserved cases, reminding his people of "the approved
teaching of the holy Fathers, that sickness and premature
death often come from sin; and that by the healing of souls
this kind of sickness is known to cease." To guard against
any possible danger of cloistered nuns being left by the
death of their chaplains without confessors, he at the same
time sent to every abbess and superior of religious women
in his diocese permission to appoint two or three fit priests,
to whom he gave faculties to hear the confessions of the
nuns.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>Before Christmas time the sickness was already in the
diocese, although it was only beginning. On the 19th of
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p110"></a>[p110]</span> January, 1349, Bishop Edyndon wrote to his official that
he had good tidings to announce—tidings which he had
received with joy—that "the most holy father in Christ,
our lord the Supreme Pontiff, had in response to the
petition of himself and his subjects, on account of the
imminent great mortality, granted to all the people of
the diocese, religious and secular, ecclesiastic and lay,
who should confess their sins with sincere repentance to
any priest they might choose—a plenary indulgence at the
hour of death if they departed in the true faith, in unity
with the holy Roman Church, and obedience and devotion to
our lord the Supreme Pontiff and his successors the Roman
Bishops." The Bishop consequently ordered that this
privilege should be made known to all as quickly as possible.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>At Winchester, as at this time in other places, difficulties
about the burial of the dead who were carried off by the
pestilence soon arose. By January many benefices in the
city had been rendered vacant, and without doubt the daily
death-roll was becoming alarming. The clergy for many
reasons were desirous of restricting burials to the consecrated
cemeteries, but a party of the citizens had clearly
made up their minds that in such an emergency as the present
the ordinary rules and laws should be, and must be,
set aside. In order, apparently, the better to enforce their
views they set upon and seriously wounded a monk of St.
Swithun's, who was conducting a funeral in the usual burial
place. The Bishop took a serious view of the offence. On
January the 21st, 1349, he addressed an order to the prior
of Winchester and the abbot of Hyde ordering sermons to
be preached on the Catholic doctrine of the resurrection
of the flesh, and excommunication to be denounced against
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p111"></a>[p111]</span> those who had laid violent hands upon brother Ralph de
Staunton, monk of Winchester. "The Catholic Church
spread over the world," he says, "believes in the resurrection
of the bodies of the dead. These have been sanctified
by the reception of the Sacraments, and are hence buried,
not in profane places, but in specially enclosed and consecrated
cemeteries, or churches, where with due reverence
they are kept, like the relics of the Saints, till the day
of the resurrection." Winchester, he continues, should set
an example to the whole diocese, and above other places
ought to reflect the brightness of the Catholic Faith.
Some people there, however, not, he thanks God, citizens,
or even those born in the city (who are wont to be conspicuous
in their upright lives and in their devotion to the
Faith), but low class strangers and degenerate sons of the
Church, lately attacked brother Ralph de Staunton whilst
burying in the appointed place, and when by his habit and
tonsure they knew him to be a monk, beat him and prevented
him from continuing to bury the dead amongst
those there waiting for the resurrection. Thinking, therefore,
that mischief was likely to ensue in regard to the true
Catholic belief in the resurrection of the dead, he orders
the doctrine to be preached in the churches of Winchester.
From all this it is quite evident that the crisis had brought
to the surface, as it had previously done in Italy, a denial
of the first principles of the Catholic Faith.</p>

<p>Bishop Edyndon further adds that seeing that "at this
time" the multitude of the faithful who are dying is greater
than ever before, provision should be made "that the people
of the various parishes may have prompt opportunity for
speedy burial," and that the old cemeteries should be
enlarged and new ones dedicated.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p>This, however, did not end the difficulties. On the 13th
of February, 1349, letters were directed by the King to the
abbot of Hyde, John de Hampton, Robert de Popham,
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p112"></a>[p112]</span> and William de Fyfhide,<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> ordering them to hear and determine
a complaint made by the Venerable Father, William
de Edyndon, Bishop of Winchester, concerning the breaking
down of walls and other boundaries of the enclosure,
whereon the abbey of Hyde formerly stood, adjoining the
cemetery of the Cathedral church of St. Swithun's, Winchester,
which had been granted to the priory by the
King, Henry I., on the removal of the abbey. It appears
from the document that "the Mayor, bailiffs, and citizens
had entered upon the usurped portions of the said land,
and employed the site thereof to hold a market twice in the
week and a fair twice in the year." By this "the bodies
of the dead had been iniquitously disturbed because,
owing to the great mortality and pestilence of late, and
the smallness of the parochial burial grounds, the Bishop
in the exercise of his office had consecrated the said ground,
and many interments had taken place in it." The Commissioners,
or two or three of them, are directed to view the
said area, cemeteries, and closes, "to empanel a jury, and
to examine evidence and generally to try the case."<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p>Taking the dates of the institutions to livings in the
county of Hampshire<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> as some indication of the period
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p113"></a>[p113]</span> when the deaths were most frequent, it would appear that
the height of the plague was reached in the months of
February, March, and April, 1349. In one month, May,
indeed, the number of benefices filled was more than double
the average of the whole twelve months of any of the three
previous years.</p>

<p>In the county of Surrey, March, April, and May were
apparently the worst months; and in the last named
the number of clergy instituted to vacant livings was
double that of the previous yearly average.<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p>Some districts were affected more than others. Thus
in the deanery of Basingstoke, in the north of Hampshire,
at one time or other, and chiefly in the month of March, by
far the greater proportion of benefices fell vacant. On the
western side of the county several institutions are made in
February, and a considerable number in March. Ivychurch
priory, in Wiltshire, where the prior died on
February 2nd, and all the rest of the community but
one quickly followed him to the grave, is situated close
to the boundaries of Hampshire, and an institution was
made to a living not far distant on February the 7th.
One of the earliest vacancies was Fordingbridge vicarage,
also not far from Wiltshire, which appointment was
made on the 21st of December, 1348. Only two days
later there was apparently the first beginning of the plague
at Southampton. The southern coast of the county
generally round about Portsmouth and Hayling island
suffered chiefly in April and March, and in the later month
are recorded numerous institutions to livings in the Isle of
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p114"></a>[p114]</span> Wight and in the country between the southdowns and
the sea. On January the 14th, 1349, a new vicar was
appointed to Wandsworth by Bishop Edyndon, "because
to our pastoral office it belongs," he says, "to have charge
of the churches, and to provide for the needs and wants,
especially whilst the present mortality among men continues
to rage."<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p>Mr. F. J. Baigent, who for many years has made the
episcopal registers and other muniments of the diocese of
Winchester his special study, writing of the effects of this
great epidemic, says: "We have no means of ascertaining
the actual havoc occasioned among the religious houses of
this diocese&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. but in the hospital of Sandown, in
Surrey, there existed not a single survivor, and of other
religious houses in the diocese (which comprises only two
counties) there perished no fewer than 28 superiors, abbots,
abbesses, and priors."</p>

<p>Of Sussex, the adjoining county to Hampshire, which is
conterminous with the diocese of Chichester, the loss of
the episcopal registers makes it difficult to speak with
certainty as to the number of clergy swept off by the
pestilence or as to its effect upon the religious houses. It
is certain, however, that the disease was not less virulent
here than in other places about which definite information
is obtainable.</p>

<p>At Winchelsea the King, in the year of the plague,
1349, granted to John de Scarle, the parson, a messuage to
the east of the cemetery of the church, which formerly
belonged to Matilda Lycotin, who had died without leaving
any heirs. "Out of devotion to St. Thomas," the King
gives this house to the church for a rectory house for
ever.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> That the town suffered considerably seems clear
from the fact that in this year, 1349, "ninety-four places in
the said town lie altogether deserted and uninhabited."<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p115"></a>[p115]</span> And both here and at Rye the bailiffs claim that in 1354
they have not received £8 1s. out of £11. 17s. 5d., supposed
to be due from them, for taxes on these towns,
because so many houses are destroyed and lie desolate
there."<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>Incidentally it is known that John de Waring, abbot of
Boxgrove, died some time before May 20th, on which day
the monks had leave to elect another superior. Also from
a chance entry in the Ely registers it appears that on July
the 25th, 1349, a new vicar was instituted to Whaddon, in
Cambridgeshire, on the presentation of the fourth prior of
the Monastery of Lewes, to which the living was appropriated.
It is explained that the reason why the fourth
superior in the house had presented was because "the
prior, sub-prior, and third prior were all dead."<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> Lastly,
a year or two after the epidemic had passed, even Battle
abbey is said to be in great straits, and "in many ways
dilapidated" (<em class="e000I2">multipliciter dilapidatur</em>), about which the
King orders an inquiry.<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

Dr.
Creighton, <em class="e000I2">History of Epidemics in Britain</em>, p. 128, quotes Rickman,
<em class="e000I2">Abstract of the Population Returns of 1831</em>, as estimating the total
deaths in London at 100,000, and considers even the 50,000 as altogether
impossible. In fact, he is inclined to think that in 1349 the population of
London "was probably not far from" 44,770 only.</p></div>

Dr. Creighton
(<em class="e000I2">ut sup.</em>, p. 129) mentions that "in the charter of incorporation
of the Company of Cutlers, granted in 1344, eight persons are named as
wardens, and these are stated in a note to have been all dead five years after,
that is to say, in the year of the Black Death, 1349, although their deaths are
not set down to the plague. Again, in the articles of the Hatters' Company,
which were drawn up only a year before the plague began (December 13, 1347)
six persons are named as wardens, and these according to a note of the time
were all dead before the 7th of July, 1350, the cause of the mortality being
again unmentioned, probably because it was familiar knowledge to those then
living. It is known also that four wardens of the Goldsmiths' Company died
in the year of the Black Death."</p></div>

<h2 title="Chapter VII. The Epidemic in Gloucester, Worcester,
Warwick, And Oxford."><a id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.
<span class="smaller">THE EPIDEMIC IN GLOUCESTER, WORCESTER, WARWICK,
AND OXFORD.</span></h2>

<p class="chap-first">In the last two chapters an account has been given of the
great plague of 1349 in the southern portion of England.
In somewhat less detail the story of its ravages in Gloucester,
Oxfordshire, and the Midlands must be here told. First,
however, the general account given in the chronicle of
Galfrid le Baker, who appears to have been a native of this
district, may here find a place.</p>

<p>In all these narratives there is, of course much repetition.
But it is just this absolute coincidence, even to the
use of the same terms, in writers of different countries, or
even of the same country, who could not have had any
communication with one another, that brings home to the
mind the literal reality of statements which, when read
each one by itself, inevitably appear as gross and incredible
exaggeration. It so raged at Bristol, writes Le Baker,
that the people of Gloucester refused those of Bristol
access to their town, all considering that the breath of
those so dying was infectious to the living. But in the
end Gloucester, and Oxford, and London, and finally all
England, were so violently attacked that hardly a tenth
part of both sexes survived. The cemeteries not being
sufficient, fields were chosen as burial-places for the dead.
The Bishop of London bought a croft, called 'No man's
land,' in London, and Sir Walter de Manny one called 'The
new church-hawe' (where he has founded a house of
religious) to bury the dead. Cases in the King's Bench
and in the Common Pleas necessarily ceased. A few
nobles died, amongst whom was Sir John Montgomery,
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p117"></a>[p117]</span> Captain of Calais and the Lord of Clistel (?) in Calais,<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> and
they were buried at the Friars of the Blessed Mary of
Carmel, in London. An innumerable number of the common
people and a multitude of religious and other clerics passed
away. The mortality attacked the young and strong especially,
and commonly spared the old and weak. Scarce anyone
dared to have contact with a sick person; the healthy
fled, leaving the goods of the dead as if infected. Swellings
suddenly breaking out in various parts of the body, racked
the sick. So hard and dry were they that, when cut,
scarcely any fluid matter came from them. From this form
of the plague many, through the cutting, after much suffering,
recovered. Others had small black pustules distributed
over the whole skin of the body, from which very few, and
indeed hardly anyone, regained life and strength.</p>

<p>"This terrible pestilence, which began at Bristol on the
Feast of the Assumption of the Glorious Virgin, and in
London about the Feast of St. Michael, raged in England
for a whole year and more so severely that it completely
emptied many country villages of every individual of the
human species.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. The following year it devastated
Wales as well as England, and then passing over to
Ireland it killed the English inhabitants there in great
numbers, but the pure-blooded Irish, living in the mountains
and high lands, it hardly touched till <em class="e0U003">A.D.</em> 1357, when
unexpectedly it destroyed them everywhere."<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>The mention by Le Baker of Wales and Ireland suggests
a brief statement of what is recorded as to the ravages of
the pestilence in these two countries. Of Wales hardly
anything is known for certain, although the few items of
information that we possess make it tolerably certain that
Le Baker's statement that it "devastated" the country is
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p118"></a>[p118]</span> not exaggerated. In April, 1350, Thomas de Clopton, to
whom the lands of the late Earl of Pembroke, Laurence de
Hastings, had been leased during the minority of the heir,
petitioned the King for a reduction of £140 out of the
£340 he had engaged to pay. The property was chiefly
situated in the county of Pembroke, and the petitioner
urges that, "by reason of the mortal pestilence lately so
rife in those parts, the ordinary value" of the land could
not be maintained. Upon inquiry the statement was found
to be true, and £60 arrears were remitted, as well as £40 a
year taken off the rent.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> No institutions for any of the
four Welsh dioceses are forthcoming; but on the supposition
that half the number of the beneficed clergy in the
Principality were carried off by the sickness, the number of
benefices in Wales being about 788, the total mortality
among the beneficed clergy would be nearly 400.</p>

<p>With regard to the religious houses in Wales also, little is
known as to the effect of the pestilence. The priory of
Abergavenny, an alien priory then in the King's hands,
was forgiven the rent due to the King's exchequer, as the
prior found it impossible to obtain payment at this time
for his lands.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> And seven-and-twenty years later, the
small number in some fairly large religious houses raises
the suspicion that they, like so many English monasteries
at this time, had not regained their normal strength
after their losses. Thus the Cistercian abbey of Whitland,
in Carmarthen, in 1377 had only a community of the abbot
and six monks; the Augustinian priory at Carmarthen had
but five beside the prior; the Premonstratensian abbey of
Tallagh only an abbot and five canons, whilst the prior of
Kidwelly, a cell of Sherborne abbey in Dorset, had not
even a socius with him.<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p>Some account of what happened in Ireland may be
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p119"></a>[p119]</span> gathered from the relation of friar John Clyn, a Minorite
of Kilkenny, who himself apparently perished in the
epidemic. "Also this year (<em class="e000I2">i.e.</em>, 1349),"<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> he writes, "and
particularly in the months of September and October,
bishops, prelates, ecclesiastics, religious, nobles and others,
and all of both sexes generally, came from all parts of
Ireland in bands and in great numbers to the pilgrimage
and the passage of the water of That-Molyngis. So much
so, that on many days you could see thousands of people
flocking there, some through devotion, others (and indeed
most) through fear of the pestilence, which then was
very prevalent. It first commenced near Dublin, at Howth<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>
and at Drogheda. These cities—Dublin and Drogheda—it
almost destroyed and emptied of inhabitants, so that,
from the beginning of August to the Nativity of our Lord,
in Dublin alone, 14,000 people died."</p>

<p>Then after speaking of the commencement of the plague
and its ravages at Avignon, the author continues:—"From
the beginning of all time it has not been heard that so
many have died, in an equal time, from pestilence, famine,
or any sickness in the world; for earthquakes, which were
felt for long distances, cast down and swallowed up cities,
towns, and castles. The plague too almost carried off
every inhabitant from towns, cities and castles, so that
there was hardly a soul left to dwell there. This pestilence
was so contagious that those touching the dead, or those
sick of it, were at once infected and died, and both the
penitent and the confessor were together borne to the
grave. Through fear and horror men hardly dared to
perform works of piety and mercy; that is, visiting the
sick and burying the dead. For many died from abscesses
and from impostumes and pustules, which appeared on the
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p120"></a>[p120]</span> thighs and under the arm-pits; others died from affection
of the head, and, as if in frenzy; others through vomiting
of blood.</p>

<p>"This year was wonderful and full of prodigies in many
ways; still it was fertile and abundant, although sickly and
productive of great mortality. In the convent of the
Minorites of Drogheda 25, and in that of Dublin 23, friars
died before Christmas.</p>

<p>"The pestilence raged in Kilkenny during Lent, for by
the 6th of March eight friars Preachers had died since
Christmas. Hardly ever did only one die in any house,
but commonly husband and wife together, with their
children, passed along the same way, namely, the way of
death.</p>

<p>"And I, brother John Clyn, of the order of Minorites,
and the convent of Kilkenny, have written these noteworthy
things, which have happened in my time and which
I have learnt as worthy of belief. And lest notable acts
should perish with time, and pass out of the memory of
future generations, seeing these many ills, and that the
world is placed in the midst of evils, I, as if amongst the
dead, waiting till death do come, have put into writing
truthfully what I have heard and verified. And that the
writing may not perish with the scribe, and the work fail
with the labourer, I add parchment to continue it, if by
chance anyone may be left in the future and any child of
Adam may escape this pestilence and continue the work
thus commenced."<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>This account of friar Clyn is borne out by one or two
documents on the Patent Rolls. Thus in July, 1350, the
Mayor and Bailiffs of Cork stated in a petition for relief
"that, both because of the late pestilence in those parts,
and the destruction and wasting of lands, houses, and possessions,
by our Irish enemies round about the said city,"
they were unable to pay the 80 marks' tax upon the
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p121"></a>[p121]</span> place.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> Also the citizens of Dublin, in begging to be
allowed to have 1,000 quarters of corn sent for their relief,
state in the petition of their Mayor "that the merchants
and other inhabitants of the city are gravely impoverished
by the pestilence lately existing in the said country, and
other many misfortunes which had happened there."<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>
Lastly, the tenants of the royal manors in Ireland asked
the King for special protection. They urged that "both
by reason of the pestilence lately existing in the said
country, and because of the excessive price of provisions
and other goods charged by some of the officers of the
land to the tenants, they are absolutely reduced to a state
of poverty."<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p>After this brief digression upon the plague in Wales and
Ireland, a return may be made to England. The county
of Worcester suffered from the disease chiefly in the
summer months of the year 1349. The institutions to
livings in the county, show that in 67 parishes out of 138
the incumbent changes at this time. In several instances
there are recorded more than one change, so that fully
half of the total number of benefices in the county were at
one time or other vacant during the progress of the disease.
The highest number of appointments to livings in the
county in any one month was in July, whilst each month
from May to November gives indication of some special
cause at work producing the vacancies. In the first four
months of the year and in December only six institutions
are recorded.<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> As examples of benefices which fell vacant
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p122"></a>[p122]</span> more than once during the period there may be adduced
Great Malvern, to which priests were presented on the
10th of July and the 21st of August; and Powick, near
Worcester, to which institutions are registered on the 15th
of May and the 10th of July.</p>

<p>In the city of Worcester, as early as the middle of April,
difficulties as to the disposal of the bodies of the dead were
foreseen and provided against by the Bishop, Wulstan de
Braunsford, who himself, an old and infirm man, died on
the 6th of August, 1349. On the 18th of April, this year,
the Bishop wrote from Hartlebury to his officials at
Worcester, to the following effect:—"Carefully considering
and not without anxiety of heart often remembering
how dangerously and excessively, alas, the burials have in
these days, to our sorrow, increased, in the cemetery of
our cathedral church at Worcester (for the great number
of the dead in our days has never been equalled); and on
this account, both for our brethren in the said church
ministering devoutly to God and His most Glorious Mother,
for the citizens of the said city and others dwelling therein,
and for all others coming to the place, because of the
various dangers which may probably await them from the
corruption of the bodies, we desire, as far as God shall
grant us, to provide the best remedy. Having deliberated
over this, we have ordained, and do ordain, that a place
fit and proper for the purpose, namely, the cemetery of the
hospital of St. Oswald, Worcester, be made to supply the
deficiency in the said cemetery of our cathedral church
arising from the said cause." He consequently orders that
it be made known to the sacrist that all burials may at
his discretion, "in the time of this mortality, be made
in the said cemetery of St. Oswald."<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>Leland mentions this cemetery in his Itinerary, where,
speaking of the "long and fayre suburbe by north without
the foregate," he says there was a chapel to St. Oswald
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p123"></a>[p123]</span> afterwards a hospital; "but of later times it was turned to
a free chapel, and beareth the name of Oswald, and here
were wont corses to be buried in time of pestilence as in a
publicke cemitory for Worcester."<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p>The general state of the country parts in the county may
be gauged by the account given by the King's Escheator
for Worcester at this time. This officer, named Leo de
Perton, was called upon, amongst other duties, to account
for the receipts of the Bishop of Worcester's estates, from
his death in August to the appointment of a successor at
the end of November, 1349. The picture of the county
generally which is presented in his reply is most distressing;
tenants, he says, could not be got at any price, mills were
vacant, forges were standing idle, pigeon houses were in
ruins and the birds all gone, the remnant of the people were
everywhere giving up their holdings; the harvest could
not be gathered, nor, had this been possible, were there
any inhabitants left in the district to purchase the produce.</p>

<p>Coming to the particular case of the Bishop's temporalities,
he claims that of £140 supposed to be due, on the
calculation of normal years, so much as £84 was never
received. For in that year, 1349, the autumn works of all
kinds were not performed. "On the divers manors of the
said bishoprick they did not, and could not, obtain more than
they allowed, on account of the dearth of tenants, who were
wont to pay rent, and of customary tenants, who used to
perform the said works, but who had all died in the deadly
pestilence, which raged in the lands of the said bishoprick,
during and before the date of the said account."</p>

<p>In the inquiry, the Escheator produced a letter from the
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p124"></a>[p124]</span> King,<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> saying that he had no wish that his official should
be charged more than he received. As a consequence of
this, two commissions were sent into the country to try, with
a jury, the matter at issue. The Escheator put in lists of
tenants from whom alone he had received anything, and in
the end the jury came to the conclusion that his statement
was correct. The particulars disclose some matters of considerable
interest in the present inquiry. For example, on
the manor of Hartlebury there had been thirty-eight
tenants called <em class="e000I2">virgates</em>, because each had farmed a virgate
of land; thirteen called nokelonds, twenty-one called arkmen
and four cottars, who rendered certain services, valued
at 106 shillings and 11–1/2d. a year, including a custom called
"yardsilver." Nothing could be got of these services,
"because all the tenants had died in the mortal sickness,
before the date of this account," and in the return of the jury
there are said to be only four tenants on the land paying
2s. 10d.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>That this was not a mere passing difficulty appears
certain when, some years later, in 1354, the same Escheator
asks for relief of £57 15s. 5–1/4d., which he could not then
obtain on the same estates, once again in his hands, by the
translation of the Bishop to another See. Speaking of the
work of the customary tenants, he says: "That he has
not obtained, and could not obtain any of these, because the
remnant of the said tenants had changed them into other
services, and after the plague, they were no longer bound to
perform services of this kind."<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<p>The results in the neighbouring county of Warwick
are naturally similar. With the counties of Gloucester
and Worcester it formed the ancient see of Worcester.
The institutions of clergy in the county, given
in Dugdale's <em class="e000I2">History of Warwickshire</em>, show that before
April and after October only seven of such institutions
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p125"></a>[p125]</span> were made, so that the pestilence was rife in the county in
the summer months of 1349, the institutions in the two
months of June and July being the highest.<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<p>In some instances the changes were very rapid; thus at
Ditchford Friary an incumbent came on July the 19th, and
by August the 22nd his successor was appointed. Kenilworth,
too, was thrice vacant between May and August.
At Coventry, on May 10th, Jordan Shepey, the Mayor, "who
built the well called Jordan well," died.<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> In July the archdeacon
of Coventry and a chantry priest at Holy Trinity
were carried off. In August the Cathedral prior, John de
Dunstable, was elected to fill the vacancy at the priory, and
shortly after Trinity church had a new incumbent. At
Pollesworth the abbess, Leticia de Hexstall, died, and a
successor was appointed on October 13th, 1349.</p>

<p>In Oxfordshire, which at the time of the great visitation
of the plague, formed part of the large diocese of Lincoln,
the number of benefices, exclusive of the Oxford colleges,
was some 220. Half this number consequently may be
estimated as that of the deaths of the beneficed clergy.
The disease was probably prevalent in the county about
the same time as in the adjacent places—that is, in
the spring and summer months of 1349. The prioress
of Godstowe, for example, died some time before May
the 20th, on which day the royal permission was given
to elect a successor, and the prior of St. Frideswide,
Oxford, very much about the same time; since on June 1st
Nicholas de Hungerford received the temporalities upon his
election.</p>

<p>The city of Oxford, with its large population of
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p126"></a>[p126]</span> students, appears to have suffered terribly. "Such a
pestilence," writes Wood, "that the like was never known
before in Oxon. Those that had places and houses in the
country retired (though overtaken there also), and those
that were left behind were almost totally swept away. The
school doors were shut, colleges and halls relinquished, and
none scarce left to keep possession, or make up a competent
number to bury the dead. 'Tis reported that no less
than 16 bodies in one day were carried to one churchyard
to be buried, so vehemently did it rage."<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> The celebrated
FitzRalph, Archbishop of Armagh, who had been Chancellor
of the University before the event, declares that in his
time of office there were 30,000 students at Oxford.<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> In
this statement he is borne out by Gascoigne, who, writing
his <em class="e000I2">Theological Dictionary</em>, in the reign of Henry VI., says:
"Before the great plague in England there were few
quarrels between the people and law cases, and so there
were also few lawyers in the kingdom of England and few
in Oxford, when there were 30,000 scholars at Oxford, as I
have seen on the rolls of the ancient Chancellors, when I
was Chancellor there."<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> This concourse was diverted by
the pestilence, since in 1357 FitzRalph declares that there
were not a third of the old number at the schools.</p>

<p>In the year of the visitation Oxford had no fewer than
three Mayors. Richard de Selwood died on the 21st April
of this year, and the burgesses then made choice of <span class="xxpn"><a id="p127"></a>[p127]</span> Richard
de Cary. Before he could reach London to take the
oath to the King he was taken sick, and the abbot of Osney
was named as Commissioner to attend at Oxford and administer
the oath of office to him. On May 19th the
abbot certified that he had done this, but on the 16th of
June, letters dated from Oxford two days previously were
received in London announcing the Mayor's death and the
election of John Dereford in his place.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p>Without doubt Oxford had its plague pit like other cities.
The late Professor Thorold Rogers, writing about this
pestilence, says: "I have no doubt that the principal place
of burial for Oxford victims was at some part of New
College garden, for when Wykeham bought the site it
appears to have been one which had been previously populous,
but was deserted some thirty years before during the
plague and apparently made a burial ground by the survivors
of the calamity."<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

The author seems to imply that the plague reached Ireland in 1348. It is,
however, probable that 1349 was in reality the date, for in that year, on July
14, Alexander de Biknor, the Archbishop of Dublin, died, and also the Bishop of
Meath in the same month (<em class="e000I2">cf.</em> Gams, <em class="e000I2">Series Episcoporum</em>, 219.)</p></div>

for the public safety as relieving the city "from an alarming evil," and by it
the parishes of St. Alban, St. Helen, St. Swithun, St. Martin, St. Nicholas, and
All Saints, "whose churchyards were very confined and not equal to the reception
of the parochial deceased, were permitted to partake of the same advantages
of sepulture.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. Hence St. Oswald's burial ground has accumulated that

<h2 title="Chapter VIII. Story of the Disease in the Rest of England.">
<a id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.
<span class="smaller">STORY OF THE DISEASE IN THE REST OF ENGLAND.</span></h2>

<p class="chap-first">The history of the great pestilence in the diocese of
Norwich which includes the two eastern counties of Norfolk
and Suffolk, has been graphically described by Dr.
Jessopp.<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> The results at which he has arrived by a careful
study of the episcopal registers of the diocese and the
court rolls of sundry manors may be very briefly summarised
here. The epidemic was at its height in the
East of England in the summer months of 1349,<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> and the
deaths in the ranks of the clergy were very alarming. The
average number of institutions in the diocese yearly for
five years before the sickness was seventy-seven. In this
single year 800 parishes lost their incumbents, 83 of them
twice, and ten three times, in a few months; and by the
close of the year two-thirds of the benefices in the diocese
had become vacant.</p>

<p>Of the seven convents of women in this district, five lost
their superiors, and in at least twelve of the religious
houses of men, including the abbey of St. Benet's Hulme,
the head died. How many of the subjects in these 19
monastic establishments were carried off by the sickness
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p129"></a>[p129]</span> can never be known; but bearing in mind what was
remarked at the time, that the disease hardly ever entered a
house without claiming many victims, and what we know of
other places of which there is definite information, the
suspicion may be allowed that the roll of the dead in the
religious houses of East Anglia was very large. At Heveringland
the prior and canons died to a man, and at Hickling
only one survived; neither house ever recovered. In
the college of St. Mary-in-the-Fields, at Norwich, five out
of the seven prebendaries were carried off, whilst the Friars
of our Lady, in the same city, are all said to have died.
Altogether, Dr. Jessopp calculates that some 2,000 clergy
in the diocese must have been carried off by the disease in
a few months.</p>

<p>From the court rolls the same evidence is adduced for
the terrible mortality among the people. Dr. Jessopp had
collected many striking proofs of this, from which one or
two examples may be quoted. On a manor called Cornard
Parva there were about 50 tenants. On 31st March three
men and six women are registered as having died in two
months. During the next month 15 men and women, seven
without heirs, were carried off, and by 3rd November there
are 36 more deaths recorded, and of these 13 have left
no relations. Thus during the incidence of the plague
some 21 families on this one manor had disappeared. The
priest of the place had died in September.<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p>To take another example. At Hunstanton on the 16th
of October, 1349, it was found that in two months 63 men
and 15 women had been carried off. In 31 instances only
women and children had been left to succeed, and in nine
there were no known heirs. In this small parish, and in
only eight months, 172 persons who were tenants of the
manor had died. Of these, 74 had left no heirs male, and
19 no blood relations at all.<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p>To these examples may be added one taken from the
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p130"></a>[p130]</span> court roll of the manor of Snetterton, about the centre of
the county of Norfolk. A court of the manor was held on
Saturday in the feast of St. James the Apostle, that is July
25th, 1349, and it is called ominously the <em class="e000I2">Curia pestilencie</em>,
the Court of the Plague. At this meeting 39 tenants of
the manor are named as having died, and in many
cases no heir is forthcoming. One tenant is specially
named as holding his house and ten acres on condition of
keeping three lamps ever burning before the Blessed
Sacrament in the parish church. He is dead and has left
no other relation, but a son 16 years of age.</p>

<p>The larger cities of East Anglia, such as Norwich and
Yarmouth, suffered no less than the country districts from
the all-pervading plague. The historian of Norfolk has
estimated the population of Norwich before this catastrophe
at 70,000.<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> It was unquestionably one of the most flourishing
cities of England, and possessed some 60 parish
churches, seven conventual establishments, as well as
other churches in the suburbs; and on the authority of an
ancient record in the Guildhall, Blomefield put down the
number of those carried off by the epidemic at 57,374.
Such a number has been considered by many as altogether
impossible, but that the city was reduced considerably does
not appear open to doubt in view of the fact that by 1368
ten parishes had disappeared and fourteen more were subsequently
found to be useless. "The ruins of twenty of
these," says a modern writer, "may still be seen."<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>Yarmouth in the middle of the fourteenth century was a
most flourishing port. When, to assist the attack of Edward
on Calais, but two years before the plague, London furnished
25 ships and 662 mariners, Yarmouth is said to have sent
43 ships and 1,950 sailors.<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> William of Worcester, in his
Itinerary, after speaking in praise of the town, says: "In the
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p131"></a>[p131]</span> great pestilence there died 7,000 people."<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> This statement
is probably based upon the number of persons buried
in one churchyard. For in a petition of burgesses of Yarmouth
in the beginning of the sixteenth century to Henry
VII. it is asserted that the prosperous condition of the town
was destroyed by the great plagues during the reign of
Edward III. In the thirty-first year of this reign, they say,—probably
mistaking the year—7,052 people were buried
in their churchyard, "by reason whereof the most part of
the dwelling-places and inhabitations of the said town
stood desolate and fell into utter ruin and decay, which
at this day are gardens and void grounds, as it evidently
appeared."</p>

<p>It is, moreover, certain that Yarmouth Church, large as it
appears in these days, was, before the plague of 1349, not
ample enough for the population,<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> and preparations had
already been made for considerably enlarging its nave.
Owing to the pestilence the work was not carried out. Nor
is this the only instance in the county where the enlargement
of churches already vast was rendered unnecessary by
the diminution of inhabitants through the sickness. It is
impossible to examine the great churches which abound in
the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk without coming to the
conclusion that they were built to serve the purposes of a
large population.</p>

<p>To take one example, the tax on the town of Dunwich
had been granted by the King to the monastery of Ely;
but in 1351 the inhabitants petitioned for relief as they
were quite unable to find the money for the royal collectors.
The King gave way to what he calls "the relation of the
men of the town of Dunwich," which recited that "the
said town, which before this time was completely inhabited
by fisher-folk, had been rendered desolate by the deadly
plague late raging in those parts, and by our enemies the
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p132"></a>[p132]</span> French seizing and killing the fishermen at sea, and still
remained so."<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p>From Norfolk and Suffolk we pass to the adjoining
county of Cambridge, which is conterminous with the
diocese of Ely. The Bishop of the diocese, Thomas de
Lisle, was abroad at the time when the plague broke out in
the county. On the 19th of May he wrote to the clergy of
his diocese, forwarding the letter of Stephen, Archbishop
of Arles, and Chamberlain of the Pope, already referred to
elsewhere. By this anyone was empowered to choose his
own confessor, "since in all places now is, or will be, the
epidemic or mortality of people which at present rages in
most parts of the world."<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> The Bishop had made arrangements
for the government of his see during his absence
abroad, but on April 9th, 1349, he wrote from Rome,
making other dispositions in view of the plague. "By
reason of the epidemic, as it is called, wonderfully increasing
in the diocese," as he has lately understood by
people from thence, he, "for fear his former Vicars
General should die," augments their number. And, further,
"considering how difficult it is for two people to agree about
the same sentence, he appoints John, prior of Barnwell,
singly and solely to dispose of all vacant benefices, and in
case of his death, or refusal to act, then Master Walter de
Peckham, LL.D., to be sole disposer of them," and then
six others in order; a provision which itself shows how
slight he considered the chance of life for any individual.
In other matters any of his Vicars General could act; and
"in case of any death putting a stop to business, as was
likely in such a mortality," whichever Vicar General was
present should act until the arrival of the three specially
appointed.<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p>The foresight of the Bishop was not unnecessary. From
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p133"></a>[p133]</span> the month of April vacancies followed quickly one upon
another. For three years previous to 1349 the average
number of institutions recorded in the episcopal registers
was nine, and in 1348 it was only seven. In this year of the
great sickness 97 appointments to livings in the diocese
were made by the Bishop's Vicars, and in July alone there
were 25.<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> The prior of Barnwell died early in the course
of the sickness, probably even before he could have
received the Bishop's commission to act for him in the
matter of vacant benefices.</p>

<p>In June there are evidences of the mortality in the
Cathedral priory of Ely. On the 23rd of the month John
de Co, Chancellor of the diocese, acting as the Bishop's
representative, according to the commission, appointed a
new sub-prior to the monastery, and again on July the 2nd
a cellarer and camerarius. A week later, on the 9th of July,
1349, "brother Philip Dallyng, late sacrist of Ely, being
dead, and the said brother Paulinus (the camerarius) being
likewise dead and both of them buried, he appointed to
both offices, namely, brother Adam de Lynsted as sacrist,
and brother John of St. Ives as camerarius."<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> At the
same time also two chantries in the Cathedral became
vacant; one, called "the green chantry," twice in two
months.</p>

<p>The number of clergy carried away by the sickness in
this diocese may be estimated from the number of vacant
benefices. Deducting the average number of yearly
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p134"></a>[p134]</span> institutions, it is fair to consider that 89 priests holding
benefices died at this time.<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> The proportion of non-beneficed
clergy to those beneficed was then probably
about the same as it was in the second year of King
Richard II. The clerical subsidy for that time shows 140
beneficed clergy against 508 non-beneficed, including the
various religious.<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> On this basis at least 350 of the clerical
order must have perished in the diocese of Ely.</p>

<p>The University town of Cambridge did not escape. On
May 24th, 1349, the church of St. Sepulchre's fell vacant,
and already in July several of the churches were without
incumbents. Towards the end of April the Master of the
hospital of St. John died, and one Robert de Spronston
was appointed to succeed. Then he died a short time
after, and one Roger de Broom was instituted on May
24th; but in his turn Roger died, and another took his
place.</p>

<p>Cambridge, too, had probably its common plague pit.
"Some years ago," writes the late Professor Thorold
Rogers, "being at Cambridge while the foundations of the
new Divinity School were being laid, I saw that the ground
was full of skeletons, thrown in without any attempt at
order, and I divined that this must have been a Cambridge
plague pit."<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p>

<p>A curious document preserved in the Bishop's archives
shows how severely some parishes must have suffered. It
is a consent given by the prior and convent of Ely to a
proposal of the Bishop to unite two parishes in Cambridge.
It mentions the churches of All Saints' and St. Giles', of
Cambridge, near the castle, and states that the parishioners
of the former are, for the most part, dead in the pestilence,
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p135"></a>[p135]</span> and those that had been left alive had gone to the parishes of
other churches. It also says that the people of St. Giles'
have died, and, further, that the nave of All Saints' is in a
ruinous state, "and the bones of the dead exposed to
beasts." The Bishop consequently proposes to unite these
two ancient parishes of Cambridge, and in this consent to
the proposal a glimpse is almost accidentally afforded of
the desolation wrought in the University town by the
terrible scourge.<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p>An example of what was probably very general throughout
the county is afforded by a roll of accounts for a
Cambridgeshire manor in this year. Considerable decay
of rents is noted, and no wonder, for it would seem that
50 tenements and 22 cottages were in hand, and that the
services which the holders would otherwise have rendered
have to be paid for. At Easter 13 copyholders' tenements
are vacant, and by Pentecost another 30 are added to the
long list.<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

<p>The clergy were reduced to the greatest straits in consequence
of the deaths among their parishioners, leading
to a proportional diminution of their incomes. On September
20th, 1349, the Bishop's Vicar addressed a letter to
John Lynot, vicar of All Saints', Jury, Cambridge.<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> "We
are informed," he says, "by your frequent complaint that
the portion coming to you in the said church is known to
consist only of offerings of the parishioners, and that the
same parishioners have been so swept away by the plague
notoriously raging in this year that the offerings of the
said church do not suffice for the necessities of life, and
that you cannot elsewhere obtain help to bear the burden
laid upon you. On this account you have humbly petitioned
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p136"></a>[p136]</span> us to be allowed to have for two years an anniversary
(mass) for your necessary support. Since your position
in God's Church does not make it fitting that you should
seek alms, particularly for necessities in food and clothing,
we grant you the permission asked on the condition
that as soon as the fruit and revenue of the said portion
be sufficient to properly furnish you with necessaries
you altogether give up the income of this anniversary
(mass)."<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> At the same time a similar permission was
granted to John Atte Welle, vicar of St. John, "in Melnstreet,"
Cambridge.</p>

<p>The adjoining county of Huntingdon forms a portion of
the great diocese of Lincoln. In it there were some 95
benefices, which may give some indication of the probable
number of deaths in the ranks of the clergy of the county.</p>

<p>The abbot of Ramsey died on the 10th of June, 1349,
and the King did not, as usual, claim the temporalities
during the vacancy, but allowed the monks to pay a
smaller sum than was usual; "and, be it remembered,"
says the document allowing this, "that because of the
depression of the said abbey by the present mortal
pestilence raging in the country, the said custody is granted
to the prior and convent for a lesser sum to pay to the
King than at the time of the last vacancy."<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>

<p>Among the <em class="e000I2">Inquisitiones post mortem</em> is one relating to
the manor of Caldecot, in Huntingdonshire. It formed
part of the estates of Margaret, Countess of Kent, who
died on St. Michael's day, 1349. Many houses of the
manor are represented as ruinous, and of no value. Rents
of assize, formerly worth £8 a year, this time produced but
fifty shillings; an old mill, which hitherto had been let with
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p137"></a>[p137]</span> land for two pounds a year, is now only worth 6s. 8d.,
"because of the pestilence it could be let at no higher
rate." And, lastly, the fees of the manor court had sunk
from 13s. 4d. to 3s. 4d. "through dearth of tenants
there."<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

<p>Proceeding westward from Huntingdonshire, the county
of Northampton next claims attention. Judged by the
lists of institutions given in Bridges' history of the county,
there were changes at this period in 131 instances out of
281. In fifteen cases two or more changes occurred in the
same place in 1349, and the number of institutions was
greatest in August, when 36 appointments were made.<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>
From the institutions it appears likely that the town of
Northampton was attacked most severely about the October
of the year 1349; at least, on November the 1st two
appointments were made to livings there.</p>

<p>As to the religious houses, at Luffield all are said to have
died of the plague. William de Skelton, the prior, was
carried off by the sickness, and the rental of the house was
subsequently declared to be inadequate for its support.
At Delaprey Convent, Catherine Knyvet, the abbess, fell
a victim to the disease. At Worthorp, the superior,
Emma de Pinchbeck, died, and probably many of the
Augustinian nuns there. The Bishop appointed Agnes
Bowes to succeed, but the convent never recovered, and in
1354 was, at the petition of its patron Sir Thomas Holland,
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p138"></a>[p138]</span> united to the convent of St. Michael near Stamford. In the
royal licence it is stated "that the convent, being poorly
endowed, was, by the pestilence which lately prevailed,
reduced to such poverty that all the nuns but one, on
account of their penury, had dispersed."<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>The inquiry just referred to, as to the estates of the
Countess of Kent upon her death in 1349, reports as to the
state of a manor in Northamptonshire. It is the same tale
of depression and desolation as appears everywhere else
throughout England. Pasture formerly worth forty shillings
now yields only ten, and some even brought in only five
shillings in place of eighteen; and the sole reason assigned
is "the mortality." A water mill and a wind mill "for
the same cause" was let for 6s. 8d., instead of the old 56
shillings.</p>

<p>The priory of Stamford itself moreover was in sad distress.
The rents from five free tenants and eighteen customary
tenants, were just one-third of their former value "for the
same cause." And the same nuns, in place of 19s. 8d.
which they used to get for thirteen tenements, now received
only four shillings, whilst their yearly tenants, who should
pay 13lbs. of pepper, at 12d. the pound, have paid nothing;
moreover the fines of the manor, estimated to produce
twenty shillings a year, have brought in but two.</p>

<p>A third example is given in the case of a manor near
Blisworth, in which two mills are let for twenty, in place
of the old rent of sixty-five shillings; and two carucates of
land produced only some fifteen shillings the carucate,
"and not more, on account of the mortality in those
parts."<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p>Of the small county of Rutland, lying at the north of
Northamptonshire, little can be said. It likewise formed
part of the diocese of Lincoln, and contained some 57
benefices. From an inquisition we learn that on one
manor for nine virgates of land there could be estimated
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p139"></a>[p139]</span> nothing in the way of rent, "because all the tenants died
before the feast of Easter (1349). They (<em class="e000I2">i.e.</em>, the jury) also
say that the natives and cottars did not work this year."
In another place, a house and garden formerly let for forty
shillings, now produces only twenty shillings; 240 acres of
arable land are let for half their former value, and 180 acres
of meadow are worth 10d. per acre, in place of eighteen-pence.<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

<p>Eastward, the county adjoining Northampton is Leicester.
For this county there exists the local account of Knighton,
a canon of Leicester abbey. As far as concerns England
his relation may fitly find a place here. "The sorrow-bearing
pestilence," he writes, "entered the sea coast at
Southampton, and came to Bristol, and almost the
whole strength of the town died as if struck with sudden
death, for there were few who kept their beds beyond
three or two days or even half a day. Then the terrible
death rolled on into all parts according to the course
of the sun, and at Leicester, in the little parish of St.
Leonard, there died more than 380; in the parish of Holy
Cross more than 400; in that of St. Margaret, Leicester,
more than 700; and so in every parish great numbers.</p>

<p>"The Bishop of Lincoln sent through his diocese a
general power to all and every priest, both regular and
secular, to hear confessions and to absolve with full and
entire episcopal power, except only in the case of debt.
In that case, if able (the penitent) himself was to make
satisfaction whilst he lived, or at least others should do so
with his property, after his death. In the same way the
Pope granted a full remission from all sins, to be obtained
once only by every one in danger of death, and he allowed
this faculty to last till the next Easter following, and each
to choose at will his own confessor.</p>

<p>"In the same year, there was a great mortality of sheep
everywhere in the kingdom; so much so, that in one place
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p140"></a>[p140]</span> there died in one pasture more than 5,000 sheep, and they
were so putrid that neither beast nor bird would touch
them. The price for everything was low; through fear
of death, very few cared for riches and the like. And
then a man could purchase a horse for half a mark,
which before had been worth forty shillings; a large
fat ox for 4s.; a cow for 12d.; a bullock for 6d.; a fat
wether for 4d.; a sheep for 3d.; a lamb for 2d.; a large
pig for 5d.; and a stone of wool for nine pence; and
sheep and cattle roamed about, wandering in fields and
through the growing harvest, and there was no one to
drive them off or collect them; but in ditches and
thickets they died in innumerable quantities in every part,
for lack of guardians; for so great a dearth of servants and
labourers existed that no one knew what to do. Memory
could not recall so universal and terrible a mortality
since the time of Vortigern, king of the Britons, in whose
reign, as Bede in his 'De gestis Anglorum' testifies, the
living did not suffice to bury the dead.</p>

<p>"In the following autumn no one could get a harvester
at a lower price than eight pence with food. For this
reason many crops perished in the fields for lack of those
to gather them; but in the year of the pestilence, as said
above of other things, there was such an abundance of
crops of all kinds that no one, as it were, cared for them."<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<p>In the absence of any definite information as to the institutions
made at this time in the county of Leicester it
is only necessary to note that the number of benefices was
about 250 at this period. There were also some twelve
religious houses and several hospitals. In 1351, as we learn
from the records, Croxton abbey still "remained quite
deserted." The church and many of the buildings had
been burnt, and "by the pestilence the abbey was entirely
deprived of those by whose ability the monastery was
then administered" (the abbot and prior alone excepted).
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p141"></a>[p141]</span> The abbot was sick, "and the said prior (in November,
1351) was fully occupied in the conduct of the Divine
Office and the instruction of the novices received there
into the community, after the pestilence."<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

<p>A slight confirmation of Knighton's account of the distress
in the country parts after the plague had passed, if
any were needed, is found in an inquisition made upon the
death of Isabella, wife of William de Botereaux, who died
upon St. James' Day, 1349. The manor held by her was at
a place called Sadington, in Leicestershire, and two carucates
of land are represented as lying uncultivated and
waste "through the want of tenants."<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<p>The adjoining county of Staffordshire formed part of the
diocese of Coventry and Lichfield. It comprised 165 benefices,
which may form some basis on which to calculate in
estimating the number of clergy who were carried off by
the pestilence. Some lands in this county, near Tamworth,
belonged to the Earl of Pembroke. Upon his death, whilst
the heir was a minor, they were farmed out at a rent of £38
per annum, to be paid to the King. In 1351 the man who
had agreed to pay that sum petitioned to have it reduced,
because "the tenements with the said land so let are so
deteriorated by the pestilential mortality lately raging in
those parts that they do not reach their wonted value."
After inquiry, his rent is reduced by £8 the year.<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

<p>Of the two counties bordering upon Wales, Hereford
and Shropshire, not much is known at this time. There
can be little doubt, however, that they suffered quite as
severely from the epidemic as the other counties of England.</p>

<p>In the diocese of Hereford, including that county and a
portion of Shropshire, the average number of institutions
to benefices, during three years before and after the
epidemic, was some 13. In 1349 there are recorded in
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p142"></a>[p142]</span> Bishop Trileck's register no fewer than 175 institutions,
and in the following year the number of 45 vacant benefices
filled up, points to the fact that many livings had probably
remained for some months without incumbents. This
suspicion is further strengthened by the frequent appearance
of the words "by lapse" in the record of institutions
at this period, which shows that for six months the living
had not been filled by the patron. It is probable, therefore,
that in the diocese of Hereford about 200 beneficed
clergy fell victims to the disease. Taking the dates of the
institutions as some indication of the period when the
epidemic was most severe in the diocese, it would appear
that the worst time was from May to September, 1349.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p>One fact bearing upon the subject of the great mortality
in the pestilence of 1349 in the county of Hereford is recorded
in the episcopal register. In 1352 the Bishop
united into one parish the two churches of Great Colington
and Little Colington, about four miles from Bromyard.
The patrons of the two livings agreed to support a petition
of the parishes to this effect, and in it they say "that the
sore calamity of pestilence of men lately passed, which
ravaged the whole world in every part, has so reduced the
number of the people of the said churches, and for that
said reason there followed, and still exists, such a paucity
of labourers and other inhabitants, such manifest sterility
of the lands, and such notorious poverty in the said
parishes, that the parishioners and receipts of both churches
scarcely suffice to support one priest."<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> The single church
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p143"></a>[p143]</span> of Colington remains to this day as a memorial of the
great mortality in that district. Even among the inhabitants
the memory of the two Colingtons has apparently
been lost.</p>

<p>In Salop the historians of the county town record that
"through all these appalling scenes (consequent upon the
great mortality of 1349) the zeal of the clergy, both secular
and monastic, was honourably distinguished. The episcopal
registers of the diocese, within which Shrewsbury is
situated, bear a like honourable testimony to the assiduity
of the secular clergy of the district."<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> From the same
source it appears that the average number of institutions
to benefices vacant by death during ten years before 1349
and ten years after are only 1–1/2 per annum, or 15 for the
whole period. In that year the number of institutions to
vacancies known to have been caused by <em class="e000I2">death</em> was 29.
If this number be taken as a guide for the general mortality,
Shropshire would appear to have suffered in an exceptional
manner. Besides these, however, there are a number of
other institutions registered at this time, the cause of
which is not specified, and many of them most probably
were also caused by the great epidemic.</p>

<p>As an example of the general destitution caused by the
great sickness, Owen and Blakeway quote an <em class="e000I2">Inquisitio
post mortem</em>, taken in the year of the plague, upon the
estate of a Shropshire gentleman, John le Strange of Blakmere.
By that record he is found by the jury to have died,
seized with various lands, etc., amongst others, the three
watermills, "which used to be worth by the year 20 marks,
but now they are worth only half that sum, by reason of
the want of those grinding, on account of the pestilence."
The same cause is assigned for the diminution of other
parts of his revenue, as tolls on markets, rent of assize, etc.</p>

<p>In the manor of Dodinton, proceeds the record of the
inquiry, "there are two carucates of land which used to be
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p144"></a>[p144]</span> worth yearly sixty shillings, and now the said jurors know
not how to value the said land, because the domestic and
labouring servants (<em class="e000I2">famuli et servientes</em>) are dead, and no
one is willing to hire the land." The water-mill has sunk
in value from thirty shillings to six-and-eightpence, because
the tenants are dead; the pond was valueless since
the fish had been taken out, and it had not been stocked
again.<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<p>This John le Strange, of Whitchurch, died on August
20th, 1349, and the inquisition held upon his estates names
three sons—Fulk, the eldest, who was married; Humphrey,
the second; and John, who was 17 years of age; and it
notes that if Fulk were to die then Humphrey his brother
was the heir. The inquiry was held upon August 30th,
ten days after the death of John, and at this very time
when Fulk was thus declared to be the heir he had himself
been dead two days. Apparently also Humphrey was
carried off by the sickness as well; because in the inquisition
subsequently held upon the estate of Fulk, John, the
third brother, is named as the heir. In this inquiry the jury
bear out the declarations of that which had testified to the
condition of the estates upon the death of the father. On
one manor it is stated that the rent of assize, which used
to be £20, is now only forty shillings, and the court fees
have fallen from forty to five shillings, "because the
tenants there are dead." And in another Shropshire
hamlet the rent of assize, formerly £4, was now "from the
said cause" only eight shillings.<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p>North of a line drawn from the Wash to the Dee, the
four counties of Chester, Derby, Nottingham, and Lincoln
stretch across England from west and east. A brief record
of the pestilence in each of these counties is all that need
be here given. In its main lines, and, indeed, almost in
its every detail, the story of one county is that of every
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p145"></a>[p145]</span> other, and it is only by chance that the account of definite
incidents has been preserved.</p>

<p>The benefices in the county of Chester numbered some
70. In the four months June, July, August, and September
thirty institutions are entered in the registers of Coventry
and Lichfield for the archdeaconry of Chester alone. The
most numerous are in the month of September.<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> The non-beneficed
clergy are, of course, not included in this
number; and in the city alone, at the end of Edward the
Third's reign, there were at least fifty or sixty of this
class. In one parish, for example, that of St. John by the
Riverside, there were nine non-beneficed vicars and six
chaplains.<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> In August a new prioress was installed at
St. Mary's, Chester, and a new prior at Norton.</p>

<p>From the ministers' accounts for the County Palatine of
Chester, at this period, some facts can be gleaned as to the
general state of desolation to which the great sickness
reduced it. Thus, in the manor of Frodsham, the bailiff
returns the receipt of only twenty shillings rent for the
lands of the manor farm, "received for 66 animals feeding
on them." He adds, "and not more this year, because he
could get no tenants by reason of the pestilence." Further
he notes the general prices as being low, and names a mill
and a bakehouse that cannot be let. As an instance of the
decay of rent it is noted that in the town of Netherton,
more than a year after the plague had ceased, eleven
houses and a great quantity of land, which fell into the
hands of the lord in the last year through the pestilence,
remain yet in his hands;" the same also is remarked of
other townships, and in one place the miller had been
allowed a reduction in his rent on account of the way his
business had fallen off since the disease.<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

<p>In the same way on another manor, that of Bucklow, at
Michaelmas 1350, it is stated that 215 acres of arable land
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p146"></a>[p146]</span> are lying waste, "for which no tenants can be found
through the pestilence, which had visited the place the previous
year. Further, those who had held a portion of the
manor land during the last year had given their holdings
up at the feast of St. Michael at the beginning of the
account (<em class="e000I2">i.e.</em>, 1349). On the same estate the rent of a
garden was put down at only 12d., because there was no
one to buy the produce. One of the largest receipts was
3s. 6d., paid by one Margery del Holes, "for the turf of
divers tenants of the manor who had died in the time of the
pestilence." On the whole of the estate there is represented
to be a decrease of £20 9s. 2–3/4d. in the rent of this
year, and a good part of the deficit is accounted for by the
fact that 34 tenants owe various sums, but cannot pay as
they have nothing but their crops, and that 46 of the
tenants had been carried off by the epidemic.</p>

<p>On the estate, moreover, it is not uninteresting to note
that a portion—no less, indeed, than a third part—of the
rent was remitted at this time. The remission, however,
hardly appears to have been made willingly, but in consequence
of a threat on the part of the holders of the manor
lands that unless it was granted they would leave. This
is noted upon the roll: "In money remitted to the tenants
of Rudheath (some four miles from Northwich) by the
Justices of Chester and others, by the advice of the lord,
for the third part of their rent by reason of the plague
which had been raging, because the tenants there wished
to depart and leave the holdings on the lord's hands, unless
they obtained this remission until the world do come better
again, and the holdings possess a greater value&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.
£10 13s. 11–3/4d."<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p>

<p>Eastward the adjoining county is Derbyshire. An
examination of the institutions for this county has been
made by the Rev. Dr. Cox for his work on the <em class="e000I2">Churches
of Derbyshire</em>. The result of his studies may here be
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p147"></a>[p147]</span> given almost in his words. In May, 1349, there is evidence
that the plague had reached Derbyshire. At that period
the total number of benefices in the county was 108, and
the average number of institutions registered yearly during
the century was only seven. In 1346 the actual number
had been but four, in 1347 only two, and in 1348 it was
eight. In the year of the plague, 1349, no fewer than sixty-three
institutions to vacant benefices are registered, and
"in the following year (many of the vacant benefices not
being filled up till then) they numbered forty-one." In this
period seventy-seven of the beneficed clergy died; that is
considerably more than half the total number, and twenty-two
more resigned their livings.</p>

<p>"Of the three vicars of Derby churches two died, whilst
the third resigned. The chantry priest of Our Lady at St.
Peter's Church also died. The two rectors of Eckington
both died, and of the three rectors who then shared the
rectory of Derley two died and one resigned. The
rectories of Langwith and Mugginton, and the vicarages of
Barlborough, Bolsover, Horsley, Longford, Sutton-on-the-Hill,
and Willington were twice emptied by the plague, and
three successive vicars of Pentrich all fell in the same fatal
year. Nor were the regular clergy more fortunate, for the
abbots of Beauchief, Dale, and Derley, the prior of
Gresley, the prior of the Dominicans at Derby, and the
prioress of King's Mead, were all taken."<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

<p>The same author has called attention to some obituary
notes in the calendar prefixed to the Chartulary of Derley
abbey.</p>

<p>"A glance at this obituary," he says, "is sufficient to
draw the attention of the reader to the remarkable number
of deaths in the year 1349.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. Of the character of the
plague we can form some idea when we consider the extent
of its ravages in a single household—a household the
most wealthy of the neighbourhood, and situated in as
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p148"></a>[p148]</span> healthy and uncrowded a spot as any that could be found on
all the fair hillsides of Derbyshire. Within three months
Sir William de Wakebridge lost his father, his wife, three
brothers, two sisters, and a sister-in-law. Sir William, on
succeeding to the Wakebridge estate, through this sad list
of fatalities, appears to have abandoned the profession of
arms and to have devoted a very large share of his wealth
to the service of God in his own neighbourhood. The great
plague had the effect of thoroughly unstringing the consciences
of many of the survivors, and a lamentable outbreak
of profligacy was the result."</p>

<p>The accounts for the Lordship of Drakelow, some four
miles from Burton-on-Trent, may be taken as a sample of
what must have been the case elsewhere. There is noted
a loss, to begin with, "upon turf sold from the waste of the
manor to tenants who had died in the time of the pestilence."
The decrease of rent is very considerable. From "the
customs of the manor there is nothing, because all these
tenants died in the time of the plague." Then follow the
names of seventy-four tenants, from all of whom only
13s. 9–3/4d. had been received in the period covered by the
account, and practically from the entire manor there had
been no receipt except for grass. Then, instead of the
harvest being gathered in, as before it had been, by means
of the services of the tenants, this year paid-labour had to
be employed at a cost of £22 18s. 10d. On the receipt
side of the account appear the values of the cows, oxen, and
horses of tenants who had died, and whose goods and
animals passed into the possession of the lord of the
manor.<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p>

<p>In Nottinghamshire the proportion of deaths among the
beneficed clergy is found, as in other cases, to be fully one-half
the total number. Out of 126 benefices in the county
the incumbent died in sixty-five.<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

<p>Eastwards, again, the county of Lincoln lies between
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p149"></a>[p149]</span> Nottinghamshire and the sea. At an early period Pope
Clement VI. granted to the priests and people of the
city and diocese of Lincoln great indulgences at the
hour of death, "since on their behalf a petition had been
made to him which declared that the deadly pestilence had
commenced in the said city and diocese."<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> The extent of
the county is large, and its endowed livings numerous.
In all, not including its forty-nine monasteries, the beneficed
clergy of the county numbered some 700, and from
this some estimate may be formed of the probable number
of clerics who died in Lincolnshire in the year 1349.</p>

<p>The chronicle of Louth Park, a Cistercian abbey in the
county, contains a brief note upon the epidemic. "This
plague," it says, "laid low equally Jew, Christian, and
Saracen; together it carried off confessor and penitent. In
many places it did not leave even a fifth-part of the people
alive. It struck the whole world with terror. Such
a plague has not been seen, or heard of, or recorded
before this time, for it is thought so great a multitude of
people were not overwhelmed by the waters of the deluge,
which happened in the day of Noah. In this year many
monks of Louth Park died; amongst them was Dom
Walter de Luda, the Abbot, on July 12th, who was much
persecuted because of the manor of Cockrington, and he
was buried before the high altar by the side of Sir Henry
Vavasour, Knight. To him Dom Richard de Lincoln
succeeded the same day, canonically elected according to
the institutes of Our Lord and the Order."<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

<p>From a document relating to the Chapter of Lincoln
it would appear that the Courts of Law did not sit every
term, during the universal visitation. The dean and chapter
complain that, whereas "from time beyond all memory"
they had received 6s. 8–1/2d. for some 66 acres of arable and
four acres of meadow at Navenby, this year they had not
done so. Still they were called upon to pay the King's
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p150"></a>[p150]</span> dues. They appealed; but there was no cause tried at
Trinity anno 23º (1349) "because of the absence of our
judges assigned to hold the common pleas, by reason of
the plague then raging."<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<p>The audit of the Escheator's accounts for the county of
Lincoln proves that the distress was very real. Saier de
Rocheford, who held the office for Rutland and Lincoln in
1351, sought to be relieved of £20 18s. 1d., which he was
charged to pay for money he should have received, on the
ground that he had got nothing, "because of the mortality."<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>
Three years later, moreover, he again pleads that
he is unable to raise more, "because of the deadly pestilence
of men and of tenants of the land, who died in the
year 1349, and on account of the dearth of tenants" since.</p>

<p>The people, he adds, were so impoverished that they could
pay nothing for "Wapentakes."<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

<p>Archbishop Zouche of York was apparently one of the first
of the English prelates to recognise the gravity of the epidemic,
which in 1348 was devastating Southern Europe, and
ever creeping northwards towards England. Before the end
of July, 1348, he wrote to his official at York, ordering prayers.
"Since man's life on earth is a warfare," he writes, "those
fighting amidst the miseries of this world are troubled by
the uncertainty of a future, now propitious, now adverse.
For the Lord Almighty sometimes permits those whom he
loves to be chastised, since strength, by the infusion of
spiritual grace, is made perfect in infirmity. It is known
to all what a mortal pestilence and infection of the atmosphere
is hanging over various parts of the world, and
especially England, in these days. This, indeed, is caused
by the sins of men who, made callous by prosperity,
neglect to remember the benefits of the Supreme Giver."
He goes on to say that it is only by prayer that the scourge
can be turned away, and he, therefore, orders that in all
parish churches, on every Wednesday and Friday, there
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p151"></a>[p151]</span> shall be processions and litanies, "and in all masses
there be said the special prayer for the stay of pestilence
and infection of this kind."<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></p>

<p>Judging from a reply of the Pope to a petition of the
Archbishop, it would be necessary to conclude that the
plague had reached York as early as February, 1349. It is,
however, more probable that the petition was sent in the
expectation that the scourge would certainly come sooner
or later, and it was best to be prepared. From the dates
of the institutions to vacant benefices, moreover, it would
seem that the province of York suffered chiefly in the
summer and autumn of the year 1349. Pope Clement VI.,
by letters to Archbishop Zouche, dated from Avignon as
early as March 23rd, 1349, bestowed the faculties and indulgences
already mentioned as having been granted to
other Bishops. This he did, as the letter says, "in response
to a petition declaring that the deadly pestilence has commenced
to afflict the city, diocese, and province of York."<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p>The county of York contained at this date some 470
benefices; or, counting monastic houses and hospitals,
some 550. It has been pointed out that out of 141 livings
in the West Riding, in which the incumbent changed in
1349, ninety-six vacancies are registered as being caused
by death, and in the East Riding 65 incumbents died against
61 who apparently survived.<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> In the deanery of Doncaster,<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>
out of fifty-six lists of incumbents, printed in the
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p152"></a>[p152]</span> local history, a change is recorded in thirty. It may be
concluded with certainty, from an examination of the printed
lists of institutions for Yorkshire, that one-half at least of
the clergy, generally, were carried off by the sickness. So
serious did the mortality among the cathedral officials
become that steps were taken to prevent the total cessation
of business. In July, 1349, for instance, "it was
ordained on account of the existing mortality of the pestilence
that one canon, with the auditor and chapter clerk,
might, in the absence of his fellows, grant vicarages and
transact other matters of business as if the other canons
were present, notwithstanding the statutes."<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

<p>The Archbishop too sought and obtained from Pope
Clement VI. faculties to dispense with the usual ecclesiastical
laws as to ordinations taking place only in the Ember
weeks. "For fear the Divine worship may be diminished
through want of ministers, or the cure and ruling of souls
be neglected," writes the Pope, we grant leave to hold
four extra ordinations during the year, since you say "that
on account of the mortal pestilence, which at present rages
in your province," you fear that "priests may not be sufficient
for the care and guidance of souls."<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> With this the
Archbishop gives a specimen of the testimonial letters to
be granted to such as were ordained under this faculty,
reciting that it was given "because of the want of ecclesiastical
ministers carried off by the pestilence lately existing
in our Province."</p>

<p>There is little doubt that the religious houses of the
diocese suffered in a similar way. The abbots of Jervaux
and Rievaulx, Welbeck and Roche, the priors of Thurgarton,
and Shelford, of Monkbretton, of Marton, of Haltemprice
and Ferriby, are only some few of the superiors of
religious houses who died at this time.</p>

<p>For one of the monasteries of the county, Meaux, there
exists a special account in the chronicles of the house.
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p153"></a>[p153]</span> Abbot Hugh, it says, "besides himself had in the convent
42 monks and seven lay brethren; and the said abbot
Hugh, after having ruled the monastery nine years, eleven
months and eleven days, died in the great plague which
was in the year 1349, and 32 monks and lay brethren
also died.</p>

<p>"This pestilence so prevailed in our said monastery, as in
other places, that in the month of August the abbot
himself, 22 monks and six lay brethren died; of these, the
abbot and five monks were lying unburied in one day, and
the others died, so that when the plague ceased, out of the
said 50 monks and lay brethren, only ten monks with no
lay brethren were left.</p>

<p>"And from this the rents and possessions of the
monastery began to diminish, particularly as a greater
part of our tenants in various places died, and the abbot,
prior, cellarer, bursar, and other men of years, and officials
dying left those, who remained alive after them, unacquainted
with the property, possessions, and common
goods of the monastery. The abbot died on 12th August,
<em class="e0U003">A.D.</em> 1349."<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>

<p>In the Deanery of Holderness, in which Meaux Abbey
was situated, there is evidence of great mortality. It is
striking to observe how frequently the bailiffs and collectors
of royal rents and taxes are changed. It is by no
means uncommon to find an account rendered by the
executors of executors to the original official.<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> This
evidence as to the great extent of the mortality here as in
other places of England, and as to the consequent distress,
is borne out by the <em class="e000I2">Inquisitiones post mortem</em> for the
period. In one case, where the owner of the property had
died on 28th July, 1349, it is said that 114 acres of pasture
were let at 12d. a year, "and not more this year because
of the mortality and dearth of men." At Cliffe, on the
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p154"></a>[p154]</span> same estate, the rents of customary tenants and tenants at
will are stated to have been usually worth £10 5s. a year;
but in this special year they had produced only two
shillings.<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>

<p>The chronicler of Meaux has described the disastrous
consequences of the sickness in his own monastery. That
this condition was not soon mended appears certain from
the fact that in 1354 it was found necessary to hand over
the abbey, "on account of its miserable condition," to a
royal commission.<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<p>The account of the King's Escheator in Yorkshire for the
year, from October, 1349, to October, 1350, states that he
could in no way obtain the sum of £4 12s. 2d., "due on
certain lands and tenements from which he had levied
and could levy nothing during the said time because of
the mortality amongst men in those parts, and owing to
the dearth of tenants, willing to take up the said land
and tenements." Then follows a list of houses standing
vacant.<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>As another instance may be quoted a case related
in the history of the deanery of Doncaster. "John
FitzWilliam, the heir of Sir William, had a short enjoyment
of the family estates. He died in the great plague
of 1349. I transcribe, to show public feeling at the time,
from a chronicle: 'And in these daies was burying
withoute sorrowe and wedding without frendschippe and
fleying without refute of socoure; for many fled from place
to place because of the pestilence; but yet they were
effecte and myghte not skape the dethe.'</p>

<p>"In another part of the deanery we find a person willing
that his goods shall be divided among such of his children
as shall remain alive. In the FitzWilliams' MS. is a contemporary
memorandum that John FitzWilliam, the father,
gave in the time of the pestilence before his death all his
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p155"></a>[p155]</span> goods and chattels, movable and immovable, to dame Joan,
his wife, John, his son, and Alleyn, late parson of Crosby,
amounting to the sum of £288 3s. 8–1/2d."<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>

<p>An incident recorded by the same writer will serve to
show how uncertain people, at this time, regarded the
tenure of life, a feeling hardly to be wondered at when
so many were dying all round them. Thomas Allott,
of Wombwell, in the deanery of Doncaster, in his will,
proved 14th September, 1349, after desiring to be buried
at Darfield, says: "Item I leave, etc., to my sons and
daughters living after this present mortal pestilence."<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

<p>These notes upon the evidence for the plague in Yorkshire
may be concluded by a brief account of the
state of Hull in consequence of the mortality and other
causes. In 1353 the King, "considering the waste and
destruction which our town of Kingston-on-Hull has
suffered, both through the overflow of the waters of the
Humber and other causes, and that a great part of the
people of the said town have died in the last deadly
pestilence which raged in these parts, and that the remnant
left in the town are so desolate and poverty-stricken in
money," grants them permission to apply the fines ordered
to be imposed on labourers and servants demanding higher
wages than before, to the payment of the fifteenth they
owe the royal exchequer.<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<p>Westward of Yorkshire the extensive but then sparsely
populated county of Lancashire stretches between it and
the Irish sea. Of this county there is practically little
to be recorded. The number of benefices which existed
in the county was about 65, whilst the number of chaplains
and non-beneficed clergy generally must have greatly
exceeded that number. In the deanery of Blackburn
alone there were at the close of the reign of Edward III at
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p156"></a>[p156]</span> least 55 capellani without benefices.<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> One document,
of its kind unique, relating to Lancashire and to this
great plague, is preserved in the Record Office. It was
long ago referred to by the late Professor Thorold
Rogers, and is now printed in the <em class="e000I2">English Historical
Review</em>. It is a statement of the supposed number of
deaths during the incidence of the great pestilence in the
deanery of Amounderness. Unfortunately, as perhaps might
be expected in such a mortality, when death came so
suddenly and men followed one another so rapidly to the
grave that vast numbers had to be cast as quickly as possible
into the same plague pit, the figures are clearly only
approximate, being in every instance round numbers.
Still, as they were adduced at a legal investigation and
before a jury, when the facts of the visitation of Providence
must have been fresh in the minds of those who heard the
evidence, it is difficult to suppose that they are mere gross
exaggerations, and may at least be taken as proof that the
mortality in this district of Lancashire was very considerable.</p>

<p>The paper in question is the record of a claim for the
profits received, or supposed to have been received, by the
dean of Amounderness, acting as procurator for the Archdeacon
of Richmond, for proof of wills, administration of
intestate estates, and other matters, during the course of
the plague of 1349. Ten parishes are named in the claim,
including Preston, Lancaster, and Garstang. In those ten
parishes it supposes that some 13,180 souls had died
between September 8th, 1349, and January 11th, 1350. In
both Preston and Lancaster 3,000 are said to have been
carried off, and in Garstang 2,000. Nine benefices are declared
to have been vacant, three of them twice, whilst the
chapel of St. Mary Magdalene, at Preston, is stated to have
been unserved for seven weeks. The Priory of Lytham is
also noted as having been rendered vacant by the sickness,
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p157"></a>[p157]</span> whilst 80 people of the village were said to have died at
the same time.<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<p>From the Patent rolls it would appear that Cartmel
Priory, also, about this time lost its superior, as upon
September 20th, 1349, the King's licence was granted to
the community to proceed to a new election.<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>

<p>The counties of Westmoreland, to the north of Lancashire,
with Cumberland, still further to the north again,
carry the western part of England to the borders of Scotland.
In the former there were some 57 beneficed clergy, and
in the latter about 85. From these figures the approximate
number of beneficed priests who died in the pestilence in
the two counties may be guessed at about 72.</p>

<p>The state of this borderland county of Cumberland was,
even before the arrival of the plague in the district, deplorable.
The Memoranda rolls of the period contain
ample evidence that the Scottish invasions had rendered
the land desolate and almost uninhabitable. Still the mortality
added to the misery of the people. The few <em class="e000I2">Inquisitiones
post mortem</em> afford little knowledge, beyond the
fact that here also the dearth of tenants was severely felt.<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>
The audit of the accounts of Richard de Denton, late Vice-Sheriff
of the County, is more precise in its information.
He declares, in excuse for the smallness of his returns, that
"the great part of the manor lands, attached to the King's
Castle at Carlisle," has remained until the year of his
account, 1354, waste and uncultivated, "by reason of the
mortal pestilence lately raging in those parts." Moreover,
for one and a half years after the plague had passed the
entire lands remained "uncultivated for lack of labourers and
divers tenants. Mills, fishing, pastures, and meadow lands
could not be let during that time for want of tenants willing
to take the farms of those who died in the said plague."
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p158"></a>[p158]</span></p>

<p>Richard de Denton then produced a schedule of particulars,
which may now be seen stitched on to the roll.
This gives the items of decrease in rents; for instance,
there are houses, cottages, and lands to let, which used to
bring in £5, and now but £1; "the farm of a garden belonging
to the King, called King's Mead, is rented now at
13 shillings and fourpence less than it used to be," and so
on. The jury, who were called to consider these statements,
concluded that Richard de Denton had proved them,
and they enter a verdict to that effect, giving a list of the
tenants, and adding "the said Richard says that all the
last-mentioned tenants died in the said plague, and all the
tenements have stood since empty through a dearth of
tenants."<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p>An indication of the same difficulties which beset the
people of Cumberland at this time is found in the case of
the prior of Hagham, an alien house, to farm which, during
the time it was in the King's hands on account of his
French war, the prior had been appointed, on condition of
his paying the sum of threepence a day in rent to be paid
to the Bishop of Carlisle. At this time he could not get
even this out of the land, and could not live, by reason of
the great dearness of provisions.<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

<p>The city of Carlisle also in 1352 was relieved of taxation
to a great extent, because "it is rendered void, and more
than usual is depressed, by the mortal pestilence lately
raging in those parts."</p>

<p>The two remaining counties of England, Durham and
Northumberland, were no exceptions to the general
mortality. In the former there were some 93 beneficed
clergy and in the latter about 72, figures from which, on
the usual calculation, may be deduced the numbers of
the beneficed clergy who died at this time.</p>

<p>In the Durham Cursitor records of this time a glimpse is
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p159"></a>[p159]</span> afforded of the state of these northern counties. The Halmote
courts were similar to the manor courts, and were
held by commissioners appointed under the great seal of
the Palatinate of Durham, by the Bishop's certificate, to
receive surrender of copyhold lands, to settle fines, contentions,
and generally to transact the business of the
estates. At one of these Halmote courts, held at Houghton
on the 14th of July, 1349, it is recorded: "that there
is no one who will pay the fine for any land, which is in
the lord's hands through fear of the plague. And so all
are in the same way of being proclaimed as defaulters
until God shall bring some remedy." At another court
"all refused their fines on account of the pestilence." In
another, after stating the receipts, the record adds: "And
not more on account of the poverty and pestilence;" and
one tenant "was unwilling to take the land in any other
way, since even if he survived the plague, he absolutely
refused to pay a fine." There are many similar instances
in the records at this period, and in one case it is
noted that "a man and his whole family had fled before
the dreaded disease."<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<p>In Northumberland the case of the people was so
desperate that in 1353 more than £600, which was owing to
the King for taxes for five and twenty parishes named,
was allowed to stand over for some months since it was
hopeless to press for payment.<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></p>

<p>Of Newcastle the same story is told. "It has been shown
us," writes the King, "in a serious complaint by the men
of Newcastle-on-Tyne, that, since very many merchants
and other rich people who were wont to pay the greater
part of the tenth, fifteenth, and other burdens of the
town, have died in the deadly pestilence lately raging
in the town, and since the population remaining alive,
who were wont to live by their trading, are by the said
pestilence and other adverse causes in this time of war,
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p160"></a>[p160]</span> so impoverished that they hardly possess sufficient to live
upon,"<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> they cannot now pay what is due.</p>

<p>At Alnwick, still further north, the plague may be traced
into the spring of the following year, 1350; at least, the
chronicle of the abbey there states that "in the year 1350
(which for them began March 25th) John, abbot of Alnwick,
died in the common mortality."<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> Lastly, it is related
by two contemporary authors that the Scotch carried the
disease over the borders into their own country. "The
Scots," writes Knighton, "hearing of the cruel pestilence
among the English, thought this had happened to them as
a judgment at the hand of God. They laughed at their
enemies, and took as an oath the expression, 'Be the foul
deth of Engelond,' and so thinking that the terrible judgment
of God had overwhelmed the English, they assembled in
the forest of Selkirk with the intention of invading England.
The terrible mortality, however, came upon them, and the
Scotch were scattered by the sudden and cruel death, and
there died in a short time about five thousand."<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<p>An account of the visitation given in the continuation
of a chronicle, probably written at the time, and possibly
by a monk at Tynemouth, may fitly conclude this review of
the course of the epidemic in England; telling, though it
does, ever the same story, and reading like an echo of the
plaint first raised in Europe on the shores of the Bosphorus
and in the islands of the Mediterranean. "In the year
of our Lord 1348, and in the month of August," writes this
chronicler, "there began the deadly pestilence in England
which three years previously had commenced in India, and
then had spread through all Asia and Africa, and coming
into Europe had depopulated Greece, Italy, Provence,
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p161"></a>[p161]</span> Burgundy, Spain, Aquitaine, Ireland, France, with its subject
provinces, and at length England and Wales, so far, at
least, as to the general mass of citizens and rustic folk
and poor, but not princes and nobles.</p>

<p>"So much so that very many country towns and quarters
of innumerable cities are left altogether without inhabitants.
The churches or cemeteries before consecrated did
not suffice for the dead; but new places outside the cities
and towns were at that time dedicated to that use by people
and bishops. And the said mortality was so infectious in
England that hardly one remained alive in any house
it entered. Hence flight was regarded as the hope of
safety by most, although such fugitives, for the most part,
did not escape death in the mortality, although they
obtained some delay in the sentence. Rectors and priests,
and friars also, confessing the sick, by the hearing of the
confessions, were so infected by that contagious disease that
they died more quickly even than their penitents; and
parents in many places refused intercourse with their
children, and husband with wife."<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>

<h2 title="Chapter IX. The Desolation of the Country.">
<a id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.
<span class="smaller">THE DESOLATION OF THE COUNTRY.</span></h2>

<p class="chap-first">So far the course of the epidemic in England has been
followed from south to north. It is now necessary to
consider some statistics and immediate results of the
plague.</p>

<p>The diocese of Salisbury comprised the three counties
of Dorset, Wilts, and Berkshire. The total number of
appointments made by the Bishop, in his entire diocese,
is said to have been 202 in the period from March 25th,
1348, to March 25th, 1349; and 243 during the same
time in the year following.<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> Of this total number of 445
it is safe to say that two-thirds were institutions to
vacancies due to the plague. Roughly speaking, therefore,
in these three counties, comprised in the diocese
of Sarum, some 300 beneficed clergy, at least, fell victims
to the scourge.</p>

<p>The county of Dorset may first be taken. The list of institutions
taken from the Salisbury episcopal registers, given
in Hutchins' history of that county, numbers 211. During
the incidence of the plague ninety of these record a change
of incumbent, so that, roughly, about half the benefices
were rendered vacant. In several cases, moreover, during
the progress of the epidemic changes are recorded twice or
three times, so that the total number of institutions made
to Dorsetshire livings at this time was 110. As regards
the non-beneficed clergy, secular and regular, their proportion
to those holding benefices will be considered in the
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p163"></a>[p163]</span> concluding chapter. Here it is sufficient to observe that
the proportion commonly suggested is far too low.</p>

<p>It is almost by chance that any information is afforded
as to the effect of the visitation in the religious houses.
All contemporary authorities, both abroad and in England,
agree in stating that the disease was always most virulent
and spread most rapidly where numbers were gathered
together, and that, when once it seized upon any house, it
usually claimed many victims. Consequently when it
appears that early in November, 1348, the abbot of
Abbotsbury died, and that about Christmas Day of that
year John de Henton, the abbot of the great monastery of
Sherborne, also died, it is more than probable that many of
the brethren of those monasteries were also carried off by
the scourge.</p>

<p>In the county of Wilts the average number of episcopal
institutions, for three years before and three years after the
mortality, was only 26. In the year 1348 there are 73 institutions
recorded in the registers, and in 1349 no less a
number than 103,<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> so that of the 176 vacancies filled in the
two years the deaths of only some 52 incumbents were
probably due to normal causes, and the rest, or some 125
priests holding benefices in the county, may be said to have
died from the plague.</p>

<p>A chance entry upon the Patent roll reveals the state of
one monastery in this county. The prior of Ederos,
or Ivychurch, a house of Augustinian canons, died on
February 2nd, 1349.<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> On February the 25th the King was
informed that death had carried off the entire community
with one single exception. "Know ye," runs the King's
letter, dated March 16th, "that since the Venerable Father
Robert, Bishop of Salisbury, cannot hold the usual election
of prior in the Monastery of Ederos in his diocese, vacant
by the death of the last prior of the same, since all the
other canons of the same house, in which hitherto there
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p164"></a>[p164]</span> has been a community of thirteen canons regular, have
died, except only one canon, brother James de Grundwell,
we appoint him custodian of the possessions, the Bishop
testifying that he is a fit and proper person for the office.<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<p>The general state of the county of Wilts after the
epidemic had passed is well illustrated from some Wiltshire
<em class="e000I2">Inquisitiones post mortem</em>. Sir Henry Husee, for
instance, had died on the 21st of June, 1349. He owned
a small property in the county. Some 300 acres of pasture
were returned upon oath, by a jury of the neighbourhood,
as "of no value because all the tenants are dead."<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> Again
John Lestraunge, of Whitchurch, a Shropshire gentleman,
had half the manor of Broughton, in the county of Wilts.
He died on July the 20th, 1349, and the inquisition was held
on August the 30th. At that time it is declared that only
seven shillings had been received as rent from a single
tenant, "and not more this year, because all the other
tenants, as well as the natives, are dead, and their land is
all in the hand of the lord."<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

<p>So, too, on the manor of Caleston, belonging to Henry de
Wilington, who died on May the 23rd, 1349, it is said that
water-mills are destroyed and worthless; of the six native
tenants two have died, and their lands are in hand; and of
the ten cottars, each of whom paid 12d. for his holding, four
have been carried off with all their family.<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> In other
places of the same county woods are declared to be valueless,
"for want of buyers, on account of the pestilence
amongst the population;"<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> from tenants who used to pay
£4 a year there is now obtained only 6s., because all but
three free tenants have been swept away;<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> 140 acres of
land and twelve cottages, formerly in the occupation of
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p165"></a>[p165]</span> natives of a manor, are all now in hand, "as all are dead."<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>
So, too, at East Grinstead, seven miles from Salisbury, on
the death of Mary, wife of Stephen de Tumby, in the
August of 1349, it is found that only three tenants are left
on the estate, "and not more because John Wadebrok and
Walter Wadebrok, Stephen and Thomas and John Kerde,
Richard le Frer, Ralph Bodde, and Thomas the Tanner,
tenants in bondage," who held certain tenements and lands,
are all dead, and their holdings are left in the hands of the
lord of the manor. Also, on the same estate, William le
Hanaker, John Pompe, Edmund Saleman, John Whermeter,
and John Gerde, jun., have also been swept away by the
all-prevailing pestilence.</p>

<p>Such examples as these will enable the reader to understand
the terrible mortality produced by this visitation, and
in some measure to appreciate the social difficulties and
changes produced by the sudden removal of so large a
number of the population from every part of the country.</p>

<p>To pass on to the neighbouring county of Somerset.
The institutions given in the episcopal registers of the
diocese of Bath and Wells show that the mortality had
already commenced in the county as early as November,
1348. The average number of inductions to livings in the
county in each month of 1348, previous to November, was
less than three; in November it was nine, and in the
following month thirty-two. During the next year, 1349,
the total number of clergy instituted to the vacant livings of
the diocese by the Bishop was 232, against an average in a
normal year of 35. For the two years, 1348 and 1349, consequently,
out of the 297 benefices to which institutions
were made, some 227 may be said, with fair certainty, to
have been rendered vacant by the great mortality which
then raged in this and other counties of England.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that the death of every
priest implied the deaths of very many of his flock, so
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p166"></a>[p166]</span> that, if no other information were attainable, some idea
of the extent of the sickness among the laity may be obtained.
It cannot but be believed that the people generally
suffered as greatly as the clergy, and that, proportionally,
as many of them fell victims to the scourge. If the proportion
of priests to lay folk was then (as some writers have
suggested) about one to fifty—an estimate, however, which
would seem to be considerably above the actual relation of
laymen to those in sacred orders at that time—the reader
can easily form some notion of the terrible mortality among
the people of Somersetshire in the first half of 1349.</p>

<p>Some slight information, however, is afforded as to the
actual state of the county in one or two instances. In each
manor throughout the country there was held periodically
what was known as the Court of the manor. At this
assembly the business of the estate, so far as the tenants
were concerned, was transacted before a chosen and sworn
jury. Holders of land under the lord of the manor came
before the court to claim their tenements and land as the
rightful heirs of tenants deceased, to pay their heriots or
fines due to the lord on every entry of a new holder. At
this assembly, too, matters of police, the infringement of
local customs, and often disputes between the tenants themselves,
were disposed of by the officials of the manor. The
record of the business of such courts is known as the Court
roll, and these documents give some information about the
extent of the mortality among the manorial tenants. Here,
however, just as in the case of the institutions of clergy,
where the actual incumbent only is registered and no
account is taken of the larger body of non-beneficed clergy,
so on the Court roll only the actual holder of the land is
entered, and no notice is taken of the members of his
family, or of others in the district, such as labourers and
servants, etc., who were not actual tenants of the manor.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the Court rolls for this period are often, if
not generally, found to be missing. They are either lost, or
the disorganised state of the country consequent upon the
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p167"></a>[p167]</span> great mortality did not permit of the court being held.
There are, however, quite sufficient of these records to
afford a tolerably good idea of what must have happened
pretty generally throughout the country. Dr. Jessopp has
been able by the use of the Norfolk Court rolls to present
his readers with a vivid picture of the havoc made by
the plague in East Anglia. As an illustration of the same,
some notes from a few Court rolls of West of England
manors may here be given.</p>

<p>The records of the royal manor of Gillingham, in the
county of Dorset, show that at a court, held on "Wednesday
next after the feast of St. Lucy (13 December), 1348,"
heriots were paid on the deaths of some twenty-eight
tenants, and the total receipts on this account, which at
ordinary courts amounted to but a few shillings, were
£28 15s. 8d. Further, at the same sittings, the bailiff
notes that he has in hand the lands and tenements of about
thirty tenants, who had apparently left no heir to succeed
to their holdings. In numbers of cases it is declared that
no heriot has been paid, and this although the receipts on
this score at the sitting of the court, and on many subsequent
sittings, are unusually large. At another court,
held early in the following year (1349) the names of two-and-twenty
tenants of the manor are recorded as having
died, and two large slips of parchment, belonging to the
court held on May 6th, give the lists of dead tenants.
Thus in the tything of Gillingham alone forty-five deaths
are recorded, and in the neighbouring tything of Bourton
seventeen.<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>

<p>The next example may be taken from the rolls of a
Wiltshire manor, and ought, perhaps, to have been given
in the account of the plague in that county. On June the
11th, 1349, a court was held at Stockton, some seven miles
from Warminster, consequently only a short distance from
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p168"></a>[p168]</span> the boundaries of Somerset. The manor, be it remarked,
was evidently only a very small one. On the parchment
record it is stated that since the previous Martinmas
(November 11th, 1348) no court had been held, and from
the entries upon the roll it appears that out of a small body
of tenants on this estate fourteen had died. How many
had been carried off in each household does not, of course,
appear, but in the majority of instances it looks very much
as if the dead tenant had left no heir behind him.<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></p>

<p>A third instance is taken from the Court roll of the
manor of Chedzoy, near Bridgwater. The plague had
made its appearance at Bridgwater, as before related,
some time previous to November 21, 1348. It was to be
expected, therefore, that the rolls of a manor only three
miles off would show some sign of the mortality among the
tenants about the same period. As a matter of fact a
glance through the parchment record of a court held on St.
Katherine's day, November 25, 1348, shows that it had
made its appearance some time between September 29th
and November 25th. On this latter day some few of the
tenants of the manor are noted as dead, and three or four
fairly large holdings have also fallen into the hands of the
lord of the manor, no heirs being forthcoming. Amongst
others, one William Hammond, who had rented and worked
a water-mill, at a place called <em class="e000I2">le Slap</em>, had been carried off
by the sickness. The house, it is noted, had since, up to
the date of the court, stood vacant. The mill wheel no
longer spun round at its work, for William Hammond, the
miller, had left no one to succeed him in his occupation.</p>

<p>But this was only a beginning. The next court was
held on Thursday after the Epiphany, January 8th, 1349.
What a terrible Christmas time it must have been for those
Somerset villagers on the low-lying ground about Bridgwater,
flooded and sodden by the long months of incessant
rain! At least twenty more tenants are marked off upon
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p169"></a>[p169]</span> the roll as dead, and as in this case the actual days of their
deaths are given, it is clear the plague claimed many
victims in this neighbourhood about the close of December,
1348.</p>

<p>Between this and March 23, 1349, the sickness was at its
worst in this manor of Chedzoy. The record of the proceedings
at the court, held on "Monday after the feast of
St. Benedict," 1349, occupies two long skins of parchment
closely written on both sides. Some 50 or 60 fines are paid
by new tenants on their taking possession of the lands and
houses, which had belonged to others now dead and gone.
Again, who can tell how many had perished in each house?
One thing is absolutely clear. In this single Somerset
village many homes had been left vacant without a solitary
inhabitant; many were taken over by new tenants not connected
with the old occupier; and in more than one
instance people came forward to act as guardians to young
children who had apparently been left alone in the world
by the death of every near relative. Take an instance. At
this court one John Cran, who, by the way, took up the
house and lands formerly held by his father, who is said to
have died, also agreed with the officer of the court to take
charge of William, the son of Nicholas atte Slope, for the
said Nicholas, and apparently every other near relative of
the boy William had perished in the sickness.</p>

<p>In this same court of March 23rd also several law cases
are disposed of, for they had been settled by the death of
one or other or both of the parties. Thus, in January, 1349,
a claim had been laid, at the sitting of the court, against
one John Lager, for the return of some cattle by three
tenants, William, John, and Roger Richeman. At the
March sitting of the court in due course the case was
called on. No plaintiffs, however, appeared, and inquiry
elicited the fact that all three had died in the great
pestilence.</p>

<p>The actual document which contains these particulars
has, moreover, a tale of its own to tell. The long entries
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p170"></a>[p170]</span> on these two skins of parchment are not all in the same
hand. Before the record of the heavy business done at
this court had been all transcribed, the clerk was changed.
The hand which had so long kept the rolls of these Manor
Courts ceases to write. What happened to him? Did he
too die? Of course nothing can be known for certain,
but it is not difficult to conjecture why another at this
very time takes up the writing of the Chedzoy manor
records.<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></p>

<p>Another glimpse of the desolate state to which the
country was generally reduced by this disastrous sickness is
afforded by the case of Hinton and Witham, the two
Somerset Carthusian houses. The King had endeavoured
by every means in his power to restrain the tenants, who
survived the plague, from leaving their old holdings and
seeking for others where they could better themselves.
Not only were fines ordered to be inflicted upon such
labourers and tenants, as endeavoured to take advantage
of the market rise in wages, but under similar penalties landowners
were prohibited from giving employment to them.
That such a law must have proved hard in the case of those
owning manors, in which some or all of the tenants and
labourers had died, is obvious. It was this hardship which
some years after the epidemic, in 1354, made the Carthusians
of Witham plead for some mitigation of the royal
decree. "Our beloved in Christ, the prior and brethren of
the Carthusian Order at Witham, in the county of Somerset,"
runs the King's reply, "have petitioned us that since their
said house and all their lands and tenements thereto belonging
are within a close in the forest of Selwood, placed
far from every town, and they possess no domain beyond
the said close, they have nothing to support the prior and
his brethren," (and this) "both because almost all their
servants and retainers died in the last pestilence, and
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p171"></a>[p171]</span> because by reason of a command lately made by us and our
Parliament, in which <em class="e000I2">inter alia</em> it is ordered that servants
should not leave their villages and parishes in which they
dwelt, as long as they could be hired there, they have been
brought to great need on account of the want of servants
and labourers. Further, that a large part of their lands (for
this same reason) remain waste and untilled, and the corn
in the rest of their estate, which had been sown at the time
of harvest, had miserably rotted as it could not be gathered
for lack of reapers. By this they have been brought into
great and manifest poverty." Looking at the circumstances,
therefore, the King permits them for the future to
engage servants and workmen on reasonable wages above
the legal sum, provided that their time of service elsewhere
had expired.<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></p>

<p>The second instance is recorded in the following year,
1355, and has reference to difficulties springing from the
same regulations as to the employment of labourers:—"The
prior and brethren of the Carthusians of Hinton, in
the county of Somerset, have petitioned us," says the
King, "that seeing that they have no support except by
the tillage of their lands, and that the greatest part of
their estates, for want of workmen and servants from the
time of the last pestilence, have been unused and still
remain uncultivated, and that they cannot get any labourers
to work their lands," (and further) "that as many people
and tenants were wont to weave the woollen cloth for the
clothes of the brethren from their wool, and do other
various services for them, now through fear of our orders
as to servants that they may not receive greater salaries
and stipends from the said brethren, do not dare to serve
them as before, and so leave their dwelling, so that the
brethren cannot get cloth to clothe themselves properly,"
they beg that these orders may be relaxed in their regard.
To which petition the King assented, allowing the
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p172"></a>[p172]</span> Carthusians of Hinton to pay the wages they had been
used to do.<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p>

<p>The diocese of Exeter, comprising the two counties of
Devon and Cornwall, was stricken by the disease apparently
about the same time as the county of Somerset. The
institutions made by the Bishop of the diocese, in January,
1349, number some 30, which shows that death had already
been busy among the clergy. The average number of
livings annually rendered vacant in the two counties during
the eight years previous to 1348 was only 36. In the year
1349 the vacancies were 382, and the number of appointments
to vacant livings, in each of the five months from
March to July, was actually larger than the previous yearly
average. It would appear, therefore, that in 1349 some
346 vacancies may reasonably be ascribed to the prevailing
sickness.</p>

<p>In looking over the lists of institutions it is evident that
the effect of sickness was felt for some years. It is not
until 1353 that the normal average is again reached. The
year following the epidemic the number of vacancies filled
up was 80, and even in 1351 it still remained at the high
figure of 57. It is curious to note in these years that
numerous benefices lapsed to the Bishop. These must
have been vacant six months, at least, before the dates
when they were filled by Bishop Grandisson. Sometimes,
no doubt, patrons were dead, leaving no heirs behind them.
Sometimes, in all probability, the patron could find no one
to fill the cure. Further, the number of resignations of
benefices during this period would appear to point to the
fact that many livings were now found to be too miserably
poor to afford a bare maintenance.</p>

<p>After the sickness was over here, as in other parts of
England, the desolation and distress is evidenced by chance
references in the inquisitions. Thus at Lydford, a manor
on Dartmoor, the King's escheator returns the value of a
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p173"></a>[p173]</span> mill at fifteen shillings, in place of the previous value of
double that amount, because "most of the tenants, who
used to grind their corn at it, have died in the plague." It
is the same at other places in the county, and in one case
30 holdings are named as having fallen into the hands of the
lord of the manor.<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></p>

<p>A bundle of accounts for the Duchy of Lancaster gives a
good idea of the effect of the pestilence in Cornwall. The
roll is for the year from Michaelmas, 1350, and includes the
accounts of several manors in the Deanery of Trigg, such
as Helston, Tintagel, and others, in the district about the
river Camel. In one it is noted that "this year there are
no buyers;" in another only two youths pay poll tax, two
more have not paid, as they have been put in charge of
some land, "and the rest have died in the pestilence." In
the same place pasture, which usually let for 3s. 4d., now,
"because of the pestilence," fetched only 20d.; the holdings
of five tenants are named as in hand, as well as nine
other tenements and 214 acres of land. Again, in another
place the rent has diminished by £7 14s., because 14 holdings
and 102 acres are in hand, together with two fulling
mills; on the other hand credit is given for 8s. 11d., the
value of the goods and chattels of the natives of the manor
who have died. And so the roll proceeds through the
accounts of some twelve or fourteen manors, and everywhere
the same story of desolation appears. Besides
numerous holdings and hundreds of acres, represented as
in hand and producing nothing, entire hamlets are named
as having been depopulated. The decay in rent of one
manor alone is set down at £30 6s. 1–3/4d.</p>

<p>Attached to the account of Helston, in Trigg, is a skin
giving a list of goods and effects of different tenants named
which the lord Prince "occupied." There are 57 items
in this list, which includes goods of all sorts, from an
article of female dress and a golden buckle to ploughs and
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p174"></a>[p174]</span> copper dishes; and the total value of the goods which thus
fell into the hands of the Black Prince, presumably by the
death of his tenants without heirs, is £16 18s. 8d.</p>

<p>At Tintagel it is noted that the "fifty shillings previously
paid each year as stipend to the chaplain who celebrated in
the chapel, was not paid this year, because no one would
stay to minister there for the said stipend."<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p>

<p>On the 29th May, 1350, the Black Prince, in view of the great
distress throughout the district, authorised his officials to
remit one-fourth part of the rents of the tenants who were
left, "for fear they should through poverty depart from
their holdings."<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> But John Tremayn, the receiver of the
revenues of the Prince in Cornwall, states that even in the
years 1352 and 1353, so far from the estates there showing
any recovery, they were in a more deplorable state still.
"For the said two years," he relates, "he has not been
able to let (the lands), nor to raise or obtain anything from
the said lands and tenements, because the said tenements
for the most part have remained unoccupied, and the lands
lain waste for want of tenants (in the place of those) who
died in the mortal pestilence lately raging in the said
county."<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>

<p>The loss of the episcopal registers of London for this
period makes it impossible to form any certain estimate of
the deaths in the ranks of the clergy of the capital
during the progress of the epidemic. London contained
within its walls, at that time, some 140 parish churches,
exclusive of the large number of religious houses grouped
together in its precincts. It is not unreasonable to suppose
that the mortality here was greater than elsewhere.
The population was closely packed in narrow streets, the
religious houses were exceptionally numerous, and many of
them, from their very situation, could have had but very little
space. It has already been seen how fatal was the entry
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p175"></a>[p175]</span> of the plague into any house, and consequently the proportion
of deaths among the regulars in London was
doubtless greater than elsewhere, whilst other causes must
have also contributed to raise the roll of death among the
seculars.<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p>

<p>The diocese of London included, with Middlesex, the
county of Essex and a portion of Hertfordshire. The
benefices of the county of Essex were in number some 265,
and, like the actual institutions of the Middlesex clergy for
this period, those made in the county of Essex are unknown.
By July, 1349, the consequences of the scourge clearly
appear in the <em class="e000I2">Inquisitiones post mortem</em> for this county.
In one manor ten acres of meadow, which had formerly
been let for twenty shillings, this year produced only half
that amount, "because of the common pestilence." For
the same reason the arable land had fallen in value, and a
water-mill was idle, as there was no miller. In another
place 140 acres of arable land was lying waste. "It cannot
be let at all," says the Inquisition, "but if it could be let,
it would be worth but eleven shillings and sixpence" only,
in place of twenty-three shillings. Here, too, pasture had
fallen fifty per cent, in value, and the wood that had been
cut could not be sold. So, too, at a manor near Maldon, in
this county, prices had fallen to half the previous value, and
here the additional information is given that, out of eleven
native tenants of the manor eight have died, and their
tenements and land were in hand. It is the same in every
instance; rents had dropped, owing to the catastrophe, to
one-half. Arable, meadow, and pasture could be obtained
this year in Essex anywhere at such a reduction. Other
estate receipts had fallen equally. In one place court fees
were three in place of the usual six shillings, and the manor
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p176"></a>[p176]</span> dove-house brought in one instead of two shillings. Water
mills were at a greater discount even than this. One, at a
place called Longford, was valued at twenty shillings in
place of sixty shillings, and even at this reduction there is
considerable doubt expressed whether it will let at all.</p>

<p>Lastly, to take one more example in the county of Essex.
An inquiry was made as to the lands held by the abbot of
Colchester, who died on August the 24th, 1349. In this it
appears that, in the manors of East and West Denny, 320
acres of arable land had fallen in yearly value from four to
two pence an acre; 14 acres of meadow from 18d. to 8d.;
the woods are valueless, "because there are no buyers;"
and out of six native tenants two are dead. In another
place four out of six have been carried off; in another,
only two are left out of seven. The rent of assize, it is
declared, is only £4, "and no more, because most of the
land is in hand."<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p>

<p>No account has been preserved of the ravages of the
pestilence at the abbey of Colchester; but the death of
the abbot at this time makes it not unlikely that the disease
was as disastrous here as in other monasteries of which there
is preserved some record. It is known that the town suffered
considerably. "One of the most striking effects was,"
writes one author, "that wills to the unusual number of
111 were enrolled at Colchester, which at that time had the
privilege of their probate and enrolment."<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p>

<p>Talkeley, an alien priory in Essex, was reduced to complete
destitution. It was a cell of St. Valery's Abbey, in
Picardy, and when seized into the King's hands on account
of the war with France the prior was allowed to hold the
lands on condition of his paying £126 a year into the royal
purse. Two years after the plague had visited the county
this payment had fallen into arrears, "by reason of the
pestilence lately raging, from which time the said land
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p177"></a>[p177]</span> remained uncultivated, and the holdings, from which the
revenues of the priory were derived, remained unoccupied
after the death of the tenants. So terribly is it impoverished
that it has nothing upon which to live, and on account of
the arrears no one is willing to rent the lands and tenements
of the priory." In the end the King was compelled
to forgive the arrears of rent.<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></p>

<p>In the county of Hertfordshire 34 benefices were in the
diocese of London, whilst 22 more were under the jurisdiction
of no Bishop, but formed a peculiar of the abbey of
St. Alban's. In both of these consequently the actual institutions
made in the year of the great plague are unknown.
For the portion within the diocese of Lincoln 27 institutions
were made in the summer of 1349; so that probably
at least 50 Hertfordshire clergy died at this time.</p>

<p>The values of land and produce fell, as in other places.
In one instance, given in an <em class="e000I2">Inquisitio post mortem</em> into
the estate of Thomas Fitz-Eustace, the lands and tenements,
formerly valued at 67 shillings, were on the 3rd of August
this year, 1349, estimated to produce only 13 shillings, and
this only "if the pasture can be let."<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> In the same way
the Benedictine convent of Cheshunt, in the county, is
declared shortly afterwards "to be oppressed with such
poverty in these days that the community have not wherewith
to live."<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p>

<p>Again the destitution and poverty produced by the pestilence
is evidenced in the case of some lands in the county,
given by Sir Thomas Chedworth to Anglesey priory in
Cambridgeshire. It had been agreed, shortly before the
scourge had fallen upon England, that the monastery
should for this benefaction endow a chantry of two secular
priests. In 1351, however, the state of Anglesey priory,
consequent on the fall in rents, made this impossible, and
the obligation was, through the Bishop, readjusted, and the
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p178"></a>[p178]</span> new document recites:—"Carefully considering the great
and ruinous miseries which have occurred on account
of the vast mortality of men in these days, to wit, that
lands lie uncultivated in innumerable places, not a few
tenements daily decay and are pulled down, rents and
services cannot be levied, nor the advantage thereof,
generally had, can be received, but a much smaller
profit is obliged to be taken than heretofore," the community
shall now be bound to find one priest only, whose
stipend shall be five marks yearly instead of six as
appointed, the value of the property being thus estimated
at less than half what it had been before.<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></p>

<p>In Buckinghamshire there were at the time between 180
and 200 benefices, in the county of Bedford some 120 and
in Berkshire 162. From these a calculation of the probable
number of incumbents carried off in 1349 by the sickness
may be made.</p>

<p>As some indication of the state to which these counties
were reduced by the scourge, a petition of the sheriff of
Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire, made to the King in
1353, may be here mentioned. He declared that it was
impossible then to pay into the Exchequer the old sums
for the farming of the hundreds, which had been usual
"before the late pestilence." Coming before the King in
February, 1353, he not only urged his petition, but claimed
to have £66 returned to him, which he had paid over and
above his receipts. For the years 1351 and 1352 he had
paid £132 for these rents, as had been usual since 1342;
but he claimed that "from the time of the pestilence the
bailiffs of the hundreds had been unwilling to take them on
such terms." An inquiry by a jury was held in both counties,
and it was declared "that since 1351 the bailiffs of the
hundreds had been able to obtain nothing for certain—except
what they could get by extortion—from the county.
Further, that the inhabitants of the said county were now
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p179"></a>[p179]</span> so diminished and impoverished that the bailiffs were
able to get nothing for the farms in that year, 1351." In
the same way also John Chastiloun, the sheriff, had received
nothing whatever for his office. In the end the sum
claimed was allowed.<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

<p>In the Canterbury portion of the county of Kent there were
some 280 benefices, which number may form the basis for a
calculation of the death roll. The condition to which this
portion of England was reduced may be estimated from
one or two examples. In 1352 the prioress and nuns of
the house of St. James' outside Canterbury were allowed
to be free from the tax of a fifteenth granted to the King,
because they were reduced to such destitution that they
had nothing beyond what was necessary to support them.<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>
Even the Cathedral priory of Christchurch itself had
to plead poverty. About 1350 the monks addressed
petitions to the Bishop of Rochester asking him to give
them the church of Westerham "to help them to maintain
their traditional hospitality." They say that "by the great
pestilence affecting man and beast," they are unable to do
this, and as arguments to induce the Bishop to allow this
impropriation, they state that they have lost 257 oxen, 511
cows, and 4,585 sheep, worth together £792 12s. 6d. Further
they state that "1,212 acres of land, formerly profitable,
are inundated by the sea," apparently from want of
labourers to maintain the sea walls.<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a>
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p180"></a>[p180]</span></p>

<p>The neighbouring county of Sussex, at the time of the
appearance of the disease, counted some 320 benefices.
From the Patent Rolls it appears that in 1349 the King
presented to as many as 26 livings in the county; amongst
these no less than five were at Hastings, at All Saints', St.
Clement's, St. Leonards, and two at the Free Chapel.<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></p>

<p>In Hampshire, including the Isle of Wight, the average
annual number of appointments to benefices for three years
previous to the pestilence was 21; in 1349 no fewer than 228
institutions are registered, so that it may fairly be said that
over 200 beneficed clergy were carried off by the sickness.</p>

<p>In the county of Surrey the total number of institutions
in 1349 was as high as 92, against a previous average of a
little over nine yearly, so that here, as in Hants, the number
of vacancies of livings was this year increased tenfold. It
may fairly be argued that of the number 92, some 80, at
least, of the vacancies were caused by the epidemic.
Several examples have already been given of the havoc
wrought by the epidemic in religious houses in which it
had effected an entrance. Where the head of a community
was carried off, it is practically certain many of the
members also would have perished, and it can be doubted
by no one who examines the facts that the pestilence
was not only terrible at the time, but had a lasting and
permanent effect upon the state of the monastic houses.
This point may be illustrated by some of the monasteries
of the diocese of Winchester.</p>

<p>In the city itself the prior of St. Swithun's and the
abbess of St. Mary's Benedictine convent both died, and
there is evidence that a large proportion of both these
communities must have perished at the same time, as well
as many at the abbey of Hyde. To take the Cathedral of
St. Swithun's first. In 1325, four and twenty years before
the great mortality, the monks in the house were 64 in
number.<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> Of these the 12 juniors on the list had not at
that time received the subdiaconate. The 34th in order in
the community had been ordained deacon on December 19th,
1310, and all the thirty below him were his juniors. It is
fair to consider that about 60 was the normal number
previous to the year 1349.<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> After that date they were
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p181"></a>[p181]</span> reduced to a number which varied between 35 and 40. In
1387 William of Wykeham exhorted the community to use
every effort to get up their strength to the original 60
members<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>; but notwithstanding all their endeavours they
were on Wykeham's death, in <em class="e0U003">A.D.</em>, 1404, only 42. At
Bishop Wayneflete's election, in 1447, there were only 39
monks; three years later only 35; and in <em class="e0U003">A.D.</em> 1487 their
number had fallen to 30, at which figure it remained till the
final dissolution of the house in the reign of Henry VIII.<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></p>

<p>The neighbouring Abbey of Hyde, a house of considerable
importance, with a community of probably
between thirty and forty monks, a century later had fallen
to only twenty. In 1488 it had risen to twenty-four,
and eight of these had joined within the previous three
years. At the beginning of the 16th century, in 1509,
the community again consisted of twenty; but on the
eve of the final destruction of the abbey there are some
signs of a recovery, the house then consisting of twenty-six
members, four of whom were novices. So impoverished
was the house by the consequences of the great mortality
that in 1352 the community were forced in order "to
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p182"></a>[p182]</span> avoid," as they say, "the final destruction of their house,"
and "on account of their pitiful poverty and want, to
relieve their absolute necessity," to surrender their possessions
into the hands of Bishop Edyndon.<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p>

<p>Financial difficulties also overwhelmed and nearly
brought to ruin the Benedictine Convent of St. Mary's,
which was reduced to about one half their former number.
To the same generous benefactor, Bishop Edyndon, they
were indebted for their escape from extinction. In fact,
it would appear that at this time many, if not most, of
the religious houses of the diocese were protected and
supported by the liberality of the Bishop and his relatives,
whom he interested in the work of preserving from
threatened destruction these monastic establishments. In
the document by which the nuns of St. Mary's acknowledge
Bishop Edyndon as their second founder, they say that
"he counted it a pious and pleasing thing mercifully to come
to their assistance when overwhelmed by poverty, and
when, in these days, evil doing was on the increase and
the world was growing worse, they were brought to the
necessity of secret begging. It was at such a time that
the same father, with the eye of compassion, seeing that
from the beginning our monastery was slenderly provided
with lands and possessions, and that now we and our house,
by the barrenness of our land, by the destruction of our
woods, and by the diminution or taking away from the
monastery of due and appointed rents, because of the
dearth of tenants carried off by the unheard-of and unwonted
pestilence," came to our assistance to avert our
entire undoing.<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a></p>

<p>Six months later the nuns of Romsey, in almost the
same words, acknowledged their indebtedness to the
Bishop.<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> Here the results of the pestilence upon the convent,
as regards numbers, are even more remarkable than
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p183"></a>[p183]</span> in the instances already given. At the election of an abbess
in <em class="e0U003">A.D.</em> 1333 there were present to record their votes 90
nuns. Early in May, 1349—that is only 16 years later—the
abbess died, for the royal assent was given to the election
of her successor, Joan Gerneys, on May 7th of that year.<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a>
What happened to the community can be gathered by the
fact that in 1478 their number is found reduced to 18, and
they never rose above 25 until their final suppression.</p>

<p>The various bodies of friars must have suffered quite as
severely as the rest of the clergy. It is, however, very
difficult to obtain any definite information about these
mendicant orders; but some slight indication of the dearth
of members they must have experienced at this period in
common with all other bodies in England, ecclesiastical and
lay, is to be found in the episcopal registers of the period.
In the diocese of Winchester, for example, the Augustinians
had only one convent, at Winchester. From September,
1346, to June, 1348, they presented four subjects for ordination
to the priesthood; from that time till Bishop Edyndon's
death, in October, 1366, only two more were ordained, both
on 22nd December, 1358. The Friars Minor had two
houses, one at Winchester, the other at Southampton; for
these, in 1347 and 1348, three priests were ordained. From
that time till the 21st of December, 1359, no more received
orders. Then two were made priests; but no further
ordinations are recorded until after Bishop Edyndon's
death. The same extraordinary want of subjects appears
in the case of the Carmelites. With them, between 1346 and
1348, eleven subjects received the priesthood. The next
Carmelite ordained was in December, 1357, and only three
in all were made priests between the great plague and the
close of the year 1366. The Dominicans also had only
one priest ordained in ten years, that is in the period from
March, 1349, to December, 1359.</p>

<p>Owing to the mortality having swept away so many of
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p184"></a>[p184]</span> their tenants, and other consequences traceable to the mortality,
the priory of St. Swithun's became heavily involved
in debt. On the 31st of December, 1352, Bishop Edyndon
determined to make a careful inquiry into the state of his
cathedral monastery, and wrote to that effect to the prior
and convent. He says in his letter that he has heard how
the temporalities have suffered severely "in these days,
both by the deaths of tenants of the church, from which
there has come a grave diminution of rent and services,
and from various other causes unknown, and that it is
burdened with excessive debts." As he himself was occupied
in the King's service, he proposes to send some officers
to inquire into these matters, and begs them to assist them
in every way. He further says that it is reported to him
"that in this our church the former fervour of devotion in
the divine service and regular observance has grown lukewarm;"
that both the monastery and out-buildings are
falling to ruins; that "guests are not received there so
honourably as before; on which account we wonder not a
little," he continues, "and are troubled the more because so
far you have not informed us" of these things. He appoints
January 21, 1353, for the beginning of the inquiry, and in a
second document names three priests, including a canon of
the diocese of Sarum and the rector of Froyle, in Hampshire,
to hold it.<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></p>

<p>Shortly after this, on January 14, 1353, Bishop Edyndon
ordered a similar inquiry to be made as to the state of
Christchurch priory, which was also heavily in debt.<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> That
the house had been seriously diminished in members seems
more than probable in view of the fact that from the date of
the plague till the beginning of 1366 no subject of the house
was ordained priest.</p>

<p>The hospital of Sandown, in Surrey, was left, as before
said, without a single inmate. On June 1, 1349, the Bishop,
in giving it into the care of a priest named William de
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p185"></a>[p185]</span> Coleton, says: "Since all and everyone of the brethren of
the Hospital of the blessed Mary Magdalene of Sandown,
in our diocese, to whom on a vacancy of the office of Prior,
or guardian, the election belonged, are dead in the mortality
of men raging in the kingdom of England, none of the
brethren being left, the said hospital is destitute both of
head and members."<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>

<p>The same state of financial ruin is known to have existed
in the case of Shireborne priory. On 8th June, 1350,
Bishop Edyndon wrote to the abbot and convent of St.
Vigor of Cérisy saying that Shireborne, which was said
to be a dependency of the abbey, was fallen into great
poverty. "The oblations of sacrifices had ceased, and
from very hunger the devotion of priests was grown tepid;
the buildings were falling to ruins, and its fruitful fields,
now that the labourers were carried off, were barren." The
priory could not hope, he considered, to recover "in their
days," and so, with the consent of the patron, he requested
the abbot to recall four of the monks to the abbey, the
priory then containing the superior and seven religious.
The same day a letter was sent to the prior of Shireborne
directing that this should be at once carried out.<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></p>

<p>One fact will be sufficient to show the state to which the
diocese was reduced after the plague had passed. On the
9th of April, 1350, the Bishop issued a general admonition
to his clergy as to residence on their cures. It had been
reported to him, he says, that some priests, to whom the
cure of souls had been committed, "neglecting, with danger
to many souls," this charge, "have most shamefully absented
themselves for their churches," so that "even the divine
sacrifices," for which these churches had been built and
adorned, "had been left off." The sacred buildings were,
he says, "left to birds and beasts," and they neither kept
the church in repair nor repaired what was falling to ruins,
"on which account the general state of the churches is one
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p186"></a>[p186]</span> of ruin." He consequently orders all priests to return to
their cures within a month, or to get proper and fitting
substitutes.<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p>

<p>In the June of the same year (1350) a special monition
was issued to William Elyot, rector of a church near Basingstoke,
at once to return to his living, as the church had been
left without service. A month later, on the 10th of July,
1350, the Bishop published a joint letter of the Archbishop
and Bishops ordering priests to serve the churches at the
previous stipends, and he adds that every parish church
must be contented with one chaplain only, "until those
parish and prebendal churches and chapels which are now,
or may hereafter be, unserved, be properly supplied with
chaplains."<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></p>

<p>There are many indications of the misery and suffering to
which the people generally were reduced in these parts.
Thus, for example, the King, whose compassion and tenderness,
by the way, are very rarely manifested, remits the tax
of the 15th due to him in the case of his tenants in the Isle
of Wight. This he does, "taking into account the divers
burdens which" these tenants have borne, "for the men
and tenants of our manors now dead and whose lands and
tenements by their deaths have come into our hands."<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>
A glance at the institutions to benefices in the island will
show that at one time or another during the prevalence of
the plague nearly every living became vacant, and some
more than once.</p>

<p>The town of Portsmouth, also, was forced to plead
poverty, and ask the remission of a tax of £12 12s. 2d.,
because "by the attacks of our enemies the French,
fires, and other adverse chances the inhabitants were very
much depressed."<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> That the "other adverse chances"
refers to the desolation caused by the pestilence appears
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p187"></a>[p187]</span> from another grant, of relief for eight years, made to the
town the previous year, because it was so impoverished
"both by the pestilence and by the burning and destruction
of the place by our enemies."<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a></p>

<p>The neighbouring island of Hayling was in even a worse
plight after the pestilence. "The inhabitants of Stoke,
Eaststoke, Northwood, Southwood, Mengham, Weston, and
Hayling, in the island of Hayling, have shown to us," says
the King, in 1352, "that they are greatly impoverished
by expenses and burdens for the defence of the said
island against the attacks of the French, and by the great
wasting of their lands by inroad of the sea, as well as by
the abandonment of the island by some who were wont to
bear the burdens of the said island. Those consequently
who are left would have to pay more than double the usual
tax were it now levied. Moreover since the greatest part
of the said population died whilst the plague was raging,
now, through the dearth of servants and labourers, the inhabitants
are oppressed and daily are falling most miserably
into greater poverty. Taking into account all this, the
King orders the collector of taxes for Southampton not
to require the old amount, but to be content with only
£6 15s. 7–1/4d.<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> Three years later Hayling priory, which as
one of the alien houses then in the King's hands had been
paying a large rent into the royal exchequer in place of
sending it over to their foreign mother house, was relieved
by the King of the payment of £57, as it was "much
oppressed in these days."<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

<p>Even in Winchester difficulties as to taxation, at this
time, led to many people leaving the city. Citizens, as
the document relating to it declares, who have long lived
there, "because of the taxation and other burdens now
pressing on them, are leaving the said city with the property
they have made in the place, so as not to contribute
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p188"></a>[p188]</span> to the said taxes. And they, betaking themselves to other
localities in the county, are leaving the said city desolate
and without inhabitants to our (<em class="e000I2">i.e.</em>, the King's) great
hurt."<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></p>

<p>An <em class="e000I2">Inquisitio post mortem</em> for a Hampshire manor,
taken in 1350, shows the fall in prices of lands and produce
after the mortality. Eighty acres of arable land,
which in normal times had been let for two marks (13s. 4d.),
now produced only 6s. 8d., or just one-half, being at the
rent of 1d. per acre in place of two pence. The same
fall is to be seen in the rent of meadow land, which let
now at 6d. instead of a shilling, and in the value of woods,
20 acres fetching only 20d., in the place of double that
amount, which it used to produce.<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></p>

<p>In Surrey it is the same story. In the inquiry made as
to the lands of William de Hastings, on the 12th March,
1349, it is declared that the tenements let on the manor
produce only thirty-six shillings because all the tenants
but ten are dead, "and the other houses stand and remain
empty for want of tenants, and so are of no value this
year." In another case a watermill is held by the jury to
be worthless because "all the tenants who used it were
dead." It had remained empty and no one could be found
to rent it. Of the land 300 acres cannot be let. The
court of the manor produced nothing, because all are
dead, and there are no receipts from the free tenants,
which used to amount to £6 a year, "because almost all
the tenants on the said manor are dead, and their tenements
remain empty for want of some to rent them."<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>

<p>In the absence of any definite information about the
institutions of clergy in the county of Gloucester, it may
be roughly estimated, from the number of benefices, that
between 160 and 170 beneficed clergy in this district
perished in the epidemic. Like other religious houses, the
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p189"></a>[p189]</span> abbey of Winchcombe was impoverished by the consequences
of the great mortality, and some years after
it was unable to support its community and meet its
liabilities. "By defect in past administration," as the
document puts it, "it is burdened with great debt, and
its state, from various causes, is so miserably impoverished
that it is necessary to place the custody of
the temporalities in the hands of a commission" appointed
by the crown.<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></p>

<p>That this is no exaggerated view of the difficulties
which beset the landed proprietors at the time, and that the
origin of the misery must be sought for in the great pestilence,
a passage in Smyth's <em class="e000I2">Lives of the Berkeleys</em>
may help to show:—"In the 23rd of this King," he writes,
"so great was the plague within this lord's manor of Hame
(in Gloucestershire) that so many workfolks as amounted
to 1,144 days' work were hired to gather in the corn of that
manor alone, as by their deaths fell into the lord's hands,
or else were forsaken by them."<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></p>

<p>The priory of Lanthony, near Gloucester, was brought to
such straits that the community were forced to apply to
the Bishop of Hereford to grant them one of the benefices
in his diocese. They have been, they say, so situated on
the high road as to be obliged to give great hospitality at
all times to rich and poor. Their property, in great part,
was in Ireland, and it had been much diminished in value
by the state of the country. The house was at this time,
October 15th, 1351, so impoverished by this and by a great
fire that, without aid, they could not keep up their charity.
For "the rents of the priory and the services, which the
tenants and natives, or serfs of the said house living on
their domain, have been wont yearly, and even daily, to
pay and perform for the religious serving God there, now,
through the pestilence and unwonted mortality by
which the people of the kingdom of England have been
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p190"></a>[p190]</span> afflicted, and, as is known, almost blotted out, are for
the greater part irreparably lost."<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></p>

<p>Some few years after the plague had passed an inquisition
held at Gloucester as to the state of the priory of
Horsleigh reveals the fact that a great number of the
tenants on the estate had died. Horsleigh was at the
period a cell of the priory of Bruton, in Somerset, and the
question before the jury at this inquiry was as to the
dilapidations caused by the prior or minister of the dependent
cell. They first found that all revenues from the
estates at Horsleigh, after a reasonable amount had been
allowed for the support of the prior and his brethren living
in the cell, should be paid to the head house of Bruton.
This the then prior, one Henry de Lyle, had not done. He
had, moreover, dissipated the goods of his house by cutting
down timber and underwood and selling cattle. Amongst
the rest he is declared to have sold "eighty oxen and cows
which had come to the house as mortuaries or heriots of
tenants who had died in the great pestilence."<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a></p>

<p>Dugdale, in his history of the county, prints some 175
lists of incumbents of Warwickshire livings. In 76 cases
there is noted a change at this period, and in several instances
more than once is a new incumbent appointed to a
living within a short period, so that in all there are some 93
institutions recorded.</p>

<p>A glimpse of the state to which the county generally was
reduced is afforded by some <em class="e000I2">Inquisitiones post mortem</em>.
As soon after the plague as 1350, at Wappenbury in
Warwickshire, three houses, three cottages, and 20 acres
of land are described as valueless and lying vacant,
because of the pestilence late past. At Alcester, on the
estate of a man who died June 20th, 1349, rents are
not received and tenements are in hand, "for the most
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p191"></a>[p191]</span> part, through the death of the holders." Again, at
Wilmacott, an inquiry was held as to the property of
Elizabeth, daughter of John de Wyncote, who died 10th
August, 1349. It is declared that the mother died on
10th June, and the daughter two months later, whilst
the great part of the land is in the hand of the owner
"by the death of the tenants in this present pestilence."<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></p>

<p>On the estate of one who died in December, 1350, it is
certified that there used to be nine villains, each farming
half a virgate of land, for which they paid eight shillings a
year. Five of these had died, and their land since had been
lying idle and uncultivated. On another portion of the
same two out of four tenants, who had six acres of land
each, have been carried off.</p>

<p>On the manor of Whitchurch, owned by Margaret de la
Beche, who died in the October of the plague year, 1349,
it is noted that there are no court fees, as all the tenements
are in hand. And in May, 1351, of another Oxfordshire
estate it is said that eight claimants out of eighteen were
dead, and no one was forthcoming to take the land; whilst
on the same, out of six native tenants, who had each paid
14 shillings, three are gone, and their land has since remained
untilled.<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p>

<p>One or two examples may be given of the difficulties
subsequently experienced by the religious houses. The
year after the plague had passed the Cistercian abbey of
Bruerne was forced to seek the King's protection against
the royal provisors and the quartering of royal servants
upon them. This Edward granted, "because it was in such
a bad state, that otherwise in a short time there would
follow the total destruction of the said abbey, and the dispersal
of the monks."<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> Even this protection, however,
did not entirely mend matters, for three years later, "to
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p192"></a>[p192]</span> avoid total ruin," the custody of the abbey was handed over
to three commissioners."<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a></p>

<p>St. Frideswide's, Oxford, was in much the same case.
In May, 1349, as we may suppose from the death of the
superior during the time of the epidemic at Oxford, the
plague had visited the monastery, and had, in all probability,
carried off many of its inmates. The deaths of
many of its tenants, moreover, must have gravely affected
its financial condition, and three years later it was found
necessary to put the temporalities in the hands of a commission.
"By want of good government," it is said, "and
through casual misfortunes, coming upon the said priory,
both because of the debts by which it is much embarrassed,
and for other causes," it is reduced to such a state that it
might easily lead to the dispersal of the canons and the
total destruction of the house.<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>

<p>Of the tenants of one manor belonging to a religious
house in the county of Oxford, it is said "that in the time
of the mortality of men or the pestilence, which was in the
year 1349, there hardly remained two tenants on the said
manor. These would have left had not brother Nicholas
de Lipton, then abbot, made new agreements with these
and other incoming tenants."<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a></p>

<p>To take but two instances more in other parts of England.</p>

<p>The year after the plague was over, in 1351, the
abbey of Barlings had to plead poverty and to beg
for the remission of a tax. It is true, they urge the building
of their new church, but likewise declare that they
have been "impoverished by many other causes." An
<em class="e000I2">Inquisitio post mortem</em> gives the same picture. Two
carucates of land, for example, brought in only forty
shillings, on account of the pestilence and general poverty
and deaths of the tenants. "For a similar reason," a mill,
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p193"></a>[p193]</span> which used to produce £2 in rent, now yields nothing;
and so on throughout every particular of the large estate.</p>

<p>In this part of the country, too, the King's officer experienced
the greatest difficulties in getting his dues, and
the Escheator pleads, in mitigation of a small return, that
during the whole of 1350 tenements have been standing
empty, in Gayton, near Towcester, in Weedon, in Weston,
and in Morton, ten miles from Brackley, as tenants cannot
be found "by reason of the mortality." He further excuses
himself for not levying on the lands and goods of the
people "on account of the pestilence."<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></p>

Judging by the ordination lists in the London Registers,
the proportion of non-beneficed clergy was very large. In the twelve
years, from 1362 to 1374, Bishop Sudbury ordained to the priesthood
456 regulars and 809 non-beneficed clergy, against 237 beneficed
priests. According to this proportion, the non-beneficed would be six
times as numerous as the beneficed.</p></div>

<h2 title="Chapter X. Some Consequences of the Great Mortality.">
<a id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.
<span class="smaller">SOME CONSEQUENCES OF THE GREAT MORTALITY.</span></h2>

<p class="chap-first">It will be evident to all who have followed the summary of
the history of the epidemic of 1349, given in the preceding
chapters, that throughout England the mortality must
have been very great. Those who, having examined the
records themselves, have the best right to form an opinion,
are practically unanimous in considering that the disease
swept away fully one-half of the entire population of England
and Wales.</p>

<p>But whilst it is easy enough to state in general terms the
proportion of the entire population which probably perished
in the epidemic, any attempt to give even approximate
numbers is attended with the greatest difficulty and can
hardly be satisfactory. At present we do not possess
data sufficient to enable us to form the basis of any
calculation worthy of the name. From the Subsidy Roll of
1377—or some 27 years after the great mortality—it has
been estimated that the population at the close of the reign
of Edward III. was about 2,350,000 in England and Wales.
The intervening years were marked by several more or less
severe outbreaks of Eastern plague; and one year, 1361,
would have been accounted most calamitous had not the
memory of the fatal year 1349 somewhat overshadowed
it. At the same time the French war continued to tax the
strength of the country and levy its tithe upon the lives of
Englishmen. It may consequently be believed that the
losses during the thirty years which followed the plague of
1349 would be sufficient to prevent any actual increase of
the population, and that somewhere about two and a half
millions of people were left in the country after the
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p195"></a>[p195]</span> epidemic had ceased. If this be so, it is probable that
previously to the mortality the entire population of the
country consisted of from four to five millions, half of
whom perished in the fatal year.<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, whilst apparently allowing that about
one-half of the population perished, so eminent an authority
as the late Professor Thorold Rogers held that the population
of England in 1349 could hardly have been greater
than two-and-a-half millions, and "probably was not more
than two millions."<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> The most recent authority, Dr.
Cunningham, thinks that "the results (<em class="e000I2">i.e.</em>, of an inquiry
into the number of the population) which are of a somewhat
negative character, may be stated as follows: (i.), that the
population was pretty nearly stationary at over two millions
from 1377 to the Tudors; (ii.), that circumstances did not
favour rapid increase of population between 1350 and
1377; (iii.), that the country was not incapable of sustaining
a much larger population in the earlier part of Edward
III.'s reign than it could maintain in the time of Henry
VI."<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> Thus the estimate first given, of the population
previous to the Black Death, may be taken as substantially
the same as that adopted by Dr. Cunningham. Mr. Thorold
Rogers, on the other hand, without entering into the
question of figures, views the problem altogether from the
standpoint of the land, the cultivated portion of which he
considers incapable of supporting a larger population than
he names.</p>

<p>In the country at large the most striking and immediate
effect of the mortality was to bring about nothing less
than a complete social revolution. Everywhere, although
the well-to-do people were not exempt from the contagion,
it was the poor who were the chief sufferers. "It is well
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p196"></a>[p196]</span> known," wrote the late Professor Thorold Rogers, "that
the Black Death, in England at least, spared the rich and
took the poor. And no wonder. Living as the peasantry
did in close, unclean huts, with no rooms above ground,
without windows, artificial light, soap, linen; ignorant of
certain vegetables, constrained to live half the year on
salt meat; scurvy, leprosy, and other diseases, which are
engendered by hard living and the neglect of every sanitary
precaution, were endemic among the population.<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a></p>

<p>The obvious and undoubted effect of the great mortality
among the working classes was to put a premium upon the
services of those that survived. From all parts of England
comes the same cry for workers to gather in the harvests,
to till the ground, and to guard the cattle. For years the
same demands are re-echoed until the landowners learnt
from experience that the old methods of cultivation, and
the old tenures of land, had been rendered impossible by
the great scourge that had swept over the land.</p>

<p>It was a hard time for the landowners, who up to this
had had it, roughly speaking, all their own away. With
rents falling to half their value, with thousands of acres of
land lying untilled and valueless, with cottages, mills and
houses without tenants, and orchards, gardens, and fields
waste and desolate, there came a corresponding rise in the
prices of commodities. Everything that the landowner
had to buy rose at once, as Professor Thorold Rogers
pointed out, "50, 100, and even 200 per cent." Iron, salt
and clothing doubled in value, and fish—and in particular
herrings, which formed so considerable a part of the food
of that generation—became dear beyond the reach of the
multitude. "At that time," writes William Dene, the
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p197"></a>[p197]</span> contemporary monk of Rochester, "there was such a dearth
and want of fish that people were obliged to eat meat on
the Wednesdays, and a command was issued that four
herrings should be sold for a penny. But in Lent there
was still such a want of fish that many, who had been wont
to live well, had to content themselves with bread and
potage."<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a></p>

<p>Then that which had been specially the scourge of the
people at large began to be looked upon as likely to prove
a blessing in disguise. The landowner's need was recognised
as the labourers' opportunity, upon which they were
not slow to seize. Wages everywhere rose to double the
previous rate and more. In vain did the King and Council
strive to prevent this by legislation, forbidding either the
labourer to demand, or the master to pay, more than the
previous wage for work done. From the first the Act was
inoperative, and the constant repetition of the royal commands,
addressed to all parts of the country, as well as the
frequent complaints of non-compliance with the regulations,
are evidence, even if none other existed, of the futility of
the legislation. Even when the King, taking into consideration
"that many towns and hamlets, both through the
pestilence and other causes, are so impoverished, and that
many others are absolutely desolate," granted, if only the
money were paid him in three months, that the fines levied
on servants and others for demanding excessive wages, and
on masters for giving them, might be allowed to go in
relief of the tax of a tenth and fifteenth due to him,<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> the
justices appointed to obtain the money plead that they
"cannot and have not been able to levy any of these
penalties."<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> The truth seems to be that masters generally
pleaded the excessive wages they were called upon to pay,
as an excuse for not finding money to meet the royal
demands, and it was for this reason rather than out of
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p198"></a>[p198]</span> consideration for the pockets of the better classes that
Edward issued his proclamations to restrain the rise of
wages. But he was quickly forced to understand "that
workmen, servants, and labourers publicly disregarded his
ordinances" as to wages and payments, and demanded, in
spite of them, prices for their services as great as during the
pestilence and after it, and even higher. For disobedience
to the royal orders regulating wages the King charged his
judges to imprison all whom they might find guilty.
Even this coercion was found to be no real remedy, but
rather a means of aggravating the evil, since districts
where his policy was carried out were quickly found to be
plunged in greater poverty by the imprisonment of those
who could work, and of those who dared to pay the market
price for labour.<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a></p>

<p>Knighton thus describes the situation:—"The King sent
into each county of the kingdom orders that harvesters
and other workmen should not obtain more than they were
wont to have, under penalties laid down in the statute made
for the purpose. But labourers were so elated and contentious
that they did not pay attention to the command of
the King; and if anyone wanted to hire them he was forced
to pay them what was asked, and so he had his choice
either to lose his harvest and crops, or give in to the proud
and covetous desire of the workmen. When this became
known to the King, he levied heavy fines upon the abbots,
priors, and the higher and lesser lords, as well as upon the
greater and smaller landowners in the country, because
they had not obeyed his orders, and had given higher
wages to their labourers; from some he exacted 100s., from
some 40s., and from some 20s., and indeed from each as
much as he could be made to pay. And he took from every
carucate throughout the whole kingdom 20s. besides a
fifteenth.</p>

<p>"Then the King arrested very many labourers and put
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p199"></a>[p199]</span> them in prison; and many fled and hid themselves in
forests and woods for the time, and those who were caught
were fined more severely still. And the greater number were
sworn not to take higher daily wages than was customary,
and were so liberated from prison. In like manner he
acted towards the artificers in towns and cities."<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a></p>

<p>To this account of the labour difficulties which followed
on the mortality may be added the relation of the Rochester
contemporary, William Dene. "So great was the want of
labourers and workmen of every art and craft," in those
days, he writes, "that a third part and more of the land
throughout the entire kingdom remained uncultivated.
Labourers and skilled workmen became so rebellious that
neither the King, nor the law, nor the justices, the
guardians of the law, were able to punish them."<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> Many
instances are to be found in the public documents at the
period of combinations of workmen for the purpose of
securing higher wages, and of their refusal to work at the
old rate of payment customary before the great mortality
had made the services of the survivors more valuable.
This, in the language of the statute, is called "the malice
of servants in husbandry." In the same way tenants who
had survived the visitation refused to pay the old rents and
threatened to leave their holdings unless substantial reductions
were made by their landlords. Thus, in an instance
already given, the landowner remitted a third part of the
rent of his tenants, "because they would have gone off and
left their holdings empty unless they had obtained this
reduction."<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></p>

<p>As a consequence of the great mortality among small
tenant farmers and the labouring classes generally, and
forced by the failure of legislation to practically cope with
the "strike" organised by the survivors, the landowners
quickly despaired of carrying on the traditional system of
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p200"></a>[p200]</span> cultivation with their own stock under bailiffs. Professor
Thorold Rogers has pointed out that "very speedily after
the plague, this system of farming by bailiff was discontinued,
and that of farming on lease adopted." The
difficulty experienced by the tenant of finding capital to
work the farms at first led to the institution of the stock
and seed lease, which, after lasting till about the close of
the fourteenth century, gave place to the ordinary land
lease, with, of course, a certain fixity of tenure, which at
this day we do not associate with that form of lease. Some
landowners tried, with more or less success, to continue the
old system; but these formed the exception, and by the
beginning of the next century the whole tenure of land
had been changed in England by the great mortality of
1349, and by the operation of the "trades unions," which
sprung up at once among the survivors, and which are
designated, in the statute against them, as "alliances,
covines, congregations, chapters, ordinances and oaths."</p>

<p>The people all at once learnt their power, and became
masters of the situation, and although for the next thirty
years the lords and landowners fought against the complete
overthrow of the mediæval system of serfdom, from the year
of the great mortality its fall was inevitable, and practical
emancipation was finally won by the popular rising of 1381.
Even to the last, however, the landowning class appear to
have remained in the dark as to the real issues at stake.
They claimed the old labour rents, by which their manor
lands had been worked, as well as the money payments for
which they had been commuted, and they desired that the
old ties of the tenant in villainage to the soil of his lord
should be maintained. Even Parliament was apparently
at fault as to the danger which threatened the established
system. It is impossible, however, to read the sermons of
the period without seeing how entirely the clergy were with
the people in their determination to secure full and entire
liberty for themselves and their posterity, and it is probably
to their countenance and advice that the preamble of an
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p201"></a>[p201]</span> Act passed in the first year of Richard II. refers when it
says: "Villains withdraw their services and customs from
their lords, by the comfort and procurement of others, their
counsellors, maintainers, and abettors, which have taken
hire and profit of the said villains and land tenants, by
colour of certain exemplifications made out of Domesday,
and affirm that they are discharged and will suffer no
distress. Hereupon they gather themselves in great routs,
and argue by such a confederacy that everyone shall resist
their lords by force."</p>

<p>One result of the change of land tenure should be
noticed. Previously to the great plague of 1349 the land
was divided up into small tenancies. An instance taken
by Professor Rogers of a parish, where every man held a
greater or a less amount of land, is a typical example of
thousands of manors all over the country. It shows, he
says, "how generally the land was distributed," and that
the small farms and portions of land, so remarkable in
France at the present day, did prevail in England five
hundred years ago. A great portion of this land, however,
although held by distinct tenants, lay in common, and it is
a very general complaint at this period that, as the fields
were undivided, they could not be used except by the
multitude of tenants, which had been carried off by the
great sickness. To render them profitable, under the
condition of things consequent upon the new system of
farming, these tracts of country had to be divided up by the
plantation of hedges, which form now so distinguishing a
mark of the English landscape as compared with that of a
foreign country.</p>

<p>The population also having by the operation of the great
mortality become already detached from the soil, before the
final extinction of serfdom, their liberation resulted not, as
in other countries, in the establishment of a large class of
peasant proprietors, but in that of a small body of large
landowners.</p>

<p>Of course, again, such a phrase must not be interpreted
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p202"></a>[p202]</span> in the modern sense, whereby a "landowner" is an
"owner" of land in a way which, in those days of custom
and perpetuity of tenure, would not have been even understood.
The change then effected rendered possible the
character of the land settlement that now prevails.</p>

<p>So terrible a mortality cannot but have had its effect
and left its traces upon the education, arts, and architecture
of the country. In the first, besides the temporary
interference with the education at the Universities, "this
pestilence forms," write the authors of the <em class="e000I2">History of
Shrewsbury</em>, "a remarkable era in the history of our
language. Before that time, ever since the Conquest,
the nobility and gentry of this country affected to converse
in French; children even construed their lessons
at school into that language. So, at least, Higden
tells us in his <em class="e000I2">Polychronicon</em>. But from the time of
'the first Moreyn,' as Trevisa, his translator, terms it, this
'manner' was 'som del ychaungide.' A school-master,
named Cornwall, was the first that introduced English
into the instruction of his pupils, and this example was
so eagerly followed that by the year 1385, when Trevisa
wrote, it had become nearly general. The clergy in all
Christian countries are the chief persons by whom the
education of youth is conducted, and it is probable that the
dreadful scourge of which we have been treating, by carrying
off many of those ancient instructors, enabled Mr.
Cornwall to work a change in the mode of teaching, which
but for that event he would never have been able to effect,
and which has operated so mighty a revolution in our
national literature."</p>

<p>With regard to architecture, traces of the effects of the
great plague are to be seen in many places. In some cases
great additions to existing buildings, which had only been
partially executed, were put a stop to and never completed.
In others they were finished only after a change had been
made in the style in vogue when the great mortality swept
over the country. Dr. Cox, in his <span class="xxpn"><a id="p203"></a>[p203]</span> <em class="e000I2">Notes on the Churches of
Derbyshire</em>, has remarked upon this. "The awful shock,"
he says, "thus given to the nation and to Europe at large
by the Black Death paralyzed for a time every art and
industry. The science of church architecture, then about
at its height, was some years recovering from the blow.
In some cases, as with the grand church of St. Nicholas,
Yarmouth, where a splendid pair of western towers were
being erected, the work was stopped and never resumed.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.
The recollection of this great plague often helps to explain
the break that the careful eye not unfrequently notes in
church buildings of the 14th century, and accounts for
the long period over which the works extended. We
believe this to be the secret of the long stretch of years
that elapsed before the noble church of Tideswell was completed
in that century; and it also affords a clue to much
other work interrupted, or suddenly undertaken, in several
other fabrics of the country."<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> To this may be added the
fact that the history of stained-glass manufacture shows
the same break with the past at this period. Not only just
at this time does there appear a gap in the continuity of
manufacture, but the first examples after the great pestilence
manifest a change in the style which had previously
existed.</p>

<p>In estimating the mortality among the clergy it has
been already noted that we have, in many instances, more
certain data to work upon than in the case of the population
at large. In each county the number of institutions
to benefices during the plague has already been noticed,
and in those cases where the actual figure cannot be
ascertained from documentary evidence, half the total
number of benefices has, in accordance with the general
result where such evidence is available, been taken to
represent the livings rendered vacant during that year.
From this it would appear that in round figures some
5,000 beneficed clergy fell victims to their duty. As
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p204"></a>[p204]</span> already pointed out this number in reality represents only
a portion of the clerical body; and in any estimate of the
whole allowance must be made for chaplains, chantry
priests, religious, and others.</p>

<p>It is, of course, possible to come to any conclusion as to
the proportion of the beneficed to the unbeneficed clergy
only by very round numbers. Turning to the Winchester
registers, for example, we find that the average number
of priests ordained in the three years previous to 1349 was
111.<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> The average number of institutions to benefices
annually during the same period was only twenty-one, so
that these figures taken by themselves seem to show that
the proportion of beneficed to unbeneficed clergy was
about one to four. On this basis, and assuming the deaths
of beneficed clergy to have been about 5,000, the total
death roll in the clerical order would be some 25,000.</p>

<p>This number, although very large, can hardly be considered
as excessive, when it is remembered that the
peculiar nature of their priestly duties rendered them
specially liable to infection; whilst in the case of the
religious, the mere fact of their living together in community
made the spread of the deadly contagion in their
ranks a certainty. The Bishops were strangely spared;
although it is certain that they did not shrink from their
duty, but according to positive evidence remained at their
posts. To their case are applicable the lines of the poet
upon the like wonderful escape of the Bishop during the
plague in the last century at Marseilles:—</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem">
<p class="poemquoteline">"Why drew Marseilles' good Bishop purer breath</p>
<p>When nature sickened, and each gale was death?"<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a>
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p205"></a>[p205]</span></p>
</div></div>

<p>On the supposition that five-and-twenty thousand of
the clerical body fell victims to the epidemic, and estimating
that of the entire population of the country one
in every hundred belonged to the clergy, and further that
the death rate was about equal in both estates, the total
mortality in the country would be some 2,500,000. This
total is curiously the same as that estimated from the
basis of population returns made at the close of the
memorable reign of Edward III., evidencing, namely, a
total population, before the outbreak of the epidemic, of
some five millions.<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p>

<p>It remains now to briefly point out some of the undoubted
effects, which followed from this great disaster, upon the
Church. It is obvious that the sudden removal of so large
a proportion of the clerical body must have caused a breach
in the continuity of the best traditions of ecclesiastical
usage and teaching. Absolute necessity, moreover, compelled
the Bishops to institute young and inexperienced, if
not entirely uneducated clerics, to the vacant livings, and
this cannot but have had its effect upon succeeding generations.
The Archbishop of York sought and obtained
permission from the Pope to ordain at any time, and to dispense
with the usual intervals between the sacred orders;—Bishop
Bateman, of Norwich, was allowed by Clement VI
to dispense with sixty clerks, who were but twenty-one years
of age, "though only shavelings," and to allow them to hold
rectories, as otherwise the divine offices of the Church
would cease altogether in many places of his diocese.</p>

<p>"At that time," writes Knighton, the sub-contemporary
canon of Leicester, "there was everywhere such a dearth
of priests that many churches were left without the divine
offices, mass, matins, vespers, sacraments, and sacramentals.
One could hardly get a chaplain to serve a
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p206"></a>[p206]</span> church for less than £10, or 10 marks. And whereas before
the pestilence, when there were plenty of priests, anyone
could get a chaplain for 5 or even 4 marks, or for 2 marks
and his board,<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> at this time there was hardly a soul who
would accept a vicarage for £20, or 20 marks. In a short
time after, however, a large number of those whose wives
had died in the pestilence came up to receive orders. Of
these many were illiterate and mere laics, except in so
far as they knew in a way how to read, although they
did not understand" what they read.<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></p>

<p>One instance of the rapidity of promotion, so that benefices
might not too long remain unfilled, may be given. In
the diocese of Winchester the registers record at this
period very numerous appointments of clerics, not in sacred
orders, to benefices. For example, in 1349 no fewer than
19 incumbents already appointed to churches in the city of
Winchester came up for ordination, and eight in the following
year. Of these 27 every one took his various orders
of sub-deacon, deacon, and priest at successive ordinations
without the normal interval between each step in the sacred
ministry.<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p>

<p>Two examples of the straits to which the Bishops were
reduced for priests are to be found in the registers of the
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p207"></a>[p207]</span> diocese of Bath and Wells. The one is the admission of a
man to the first step to Orders, in the lifetime of his wife,
she giving her consent, and promising to keep chaste, but
not, as was usually required under such circumstances,
being compelled to enter the cloister, "because she was
aged, and could without suspicion remain in the world."<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a>
The second instance in the same register of a difficulty
experienced in filling up vacancies is the case of a permission
given to Adam, the rector of Hinton Bluet, to say
mass on Sundays and feast days in the chapel of William
de Sutton, even although he had before celebrated the
solemnities of the mass in his church of Hinton.<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>

<p>Another curious case, which we may suspect really
came from the same cause, is noted at an ordination held
in December, 1352, at Ely. Of the four then receiving the
priesthood two were monks, and from the other two an
oath of obedience to the Bishop and his successors was
enacted, together with a promise "that they would serve
any parish church to which they might be called."<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a></p>

<p>Many instances could be given of the ignorance consequent
upon the ordinations being hurried on, and upon
laymen, otherwise unfitted for the sacred mission, being too
hastily admitted to the vacant cures. To take but two
instances, from Winchester, which may serve to illustrate
this and at the same time to show the zeal with
which the mediæval Bishops endeavoured to guard against
the evil. On 24th June, 1385, the illustrious William of
Wykeham, Bishop of Winchester, caused Sir Roger Dene,
Rector of the church of St. Michael, in Jewry Street,
Winchester, to swear upon the Holy Gospels that he would
learn within twelve months the articles of faith, the cases
reserved to the Bishop, the Ten Commandments, the
seven works of mercy, the seven mortal sins, the Sacraments
of the Church, and the form of administering and
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p208"></a>[p208]</span> conferring them, and also the form of baptizing, etc., as
contained in the Constitutions of Archbishop Peckham.<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a>
The same year, on July 2nd, the Bishop exacted from John
Corbet, who on the 2nd of June previous had been instituted
to the rectory of Bradley, in Hampshire, a similar
obligation to learn the same, before the feast of St. Michael
then next ensuing. In the former case Roger Dene had
been rector of Ryston, in Norfolk, and had been instituted
to his living at Winchester by the Bishop of Norwich only
on 21st June, 1358, three days before Bishop William of
Wykeham required him to enter into the obligation detailed
above.<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></p>

<p>It has been already remarked that one obvious result of
the great mortality, so far as the Church is concerned, was
the extraordinary decrease in the number of candidates for
sacred orders. In the Winchester diocese, for example,
the average number of priests ordained in each of the three
years preceding 1349 was 111; whilst in the 15 subsequent
years, up to 1365, when Bishop Edyndon died, the yearly
average was barely 20; and in the thirty-four years,
from 1367 to 1400, even with so zealous a prelate as
William of Wykeham presiding over the diocese, the annual
average number of ordinations to the sacred priesthood
was only 27; a number which was further decreased
during the progress of the 15th century.<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></p>

<p>The same striking result of the plague, which cannot but
have had a very serious effect upon the Church at large, is
manifested elsewhere. The Ely registers, for example,
show that the average number of all those ordained, for
the seven years before 1349, was 101–1/2; whilst for the
seven years after that date it was but 40–1/2. In 1349
no ordinations whatever apparently were held, and
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p209"></a>[p209]</span> the average number of priests ordained yearly, from
1374 to 1394, was only 14. In fact the total number
ordained in that period was only 282, whilst of these many
entered the priesthood for other dioceses, and more than
half, namely 161, were members of the various religious
orders; so that the ranks of the diocesan clergy of Ely
appear to have received but few recruits during the whole
of this time.</p>

<p>In the diocese of Hereford, to take another example,
previously to 1349, there were some very large ordinations.
Thus, in 1346, on the 11th of March, 438 people were
ordained to various grades in the sacred ministry. Of
these some 89 received the priesthood, 49 of them being
ordained for the diocese of Hereford. Again, on the 10th
of June in the same year, Bishop Trileck conferred orders,
in the parish church of Ledbury, upon 451 candidates, of
whom 148 were made priests; 56 being intended for his own
diocese. Altogether, in that year, some 319 priests were
ordained by the Bishop; half of the number being his own
clergy.<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> About the same numbers were ordained in the year
of the plague itself, 1349, and 371 in the following year. In
fact, till 1353 the number remains large, but the greater
portion of those ordained were intended for other dioceses.
The subjects of the Bishop of Hereford at once show a
falling off similar to that noticed in Winchester and Ely.
Thus, from 1345 to 1349, the average number of subjects
ordained by the Bishop for his own diocese was 72. In
the next five years it was only 34, whilst in no subsequent
year during Bishop Trileck's pontificate did it rise
above 23.</p>

<p>The above three examples will be sufficient to show how
seriously the great pestilence affected the supply of clergy.
The reason is not difficult to divine. The great dearth of
population created a proportionate demand upon the services
of the survivors to carry on the business of the
nation, and the greater pressure of business thus brought
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p210"></a>[p210]</span> about, and the higher wages to be, in fact, obtained, in spite
of royal prohibitions, were not favourable to the development
of vocations to the clerical life. The void thus
caused by the overwhelming misfortunes of the great
mortality was enlarged by the exigencies of the English
war with France, whilst popular disturbances, and the
subsequent Wars of the Roses, maintained the same
causes in operation till far into the reigns of the Tudor
sovereigns.</p>

<p>To some extent, the dearth of students at Oxford and
Cambridge, which has already been referred to, was brought
about by the same causes, and it certainly followed immediately
upon the fatal year of 1349. At Oxford, no
doubt, the serious disturbances, which took place at this
time between the students and townsfolk, contributed to
aggravate the evil. So serious, indeed, had the state of the
great centre of clerical education in England become, in
less than six years after the pestilence, that the King was
compelled to address the Bishops on the subject. He begs
them to help in the task of renewing the University;
"knowing," he says, "how the Catholic faith is chiefly
supported by the learning of the clergy, and the State
governed by their prudence, we earnestly desire that, particularly
in our kingdom of England, the clerical order may
be increased in number, morals, and knowledge." But,
"in the city of Oxford, in which the fount and source of
clerical knowledge" has long existed, owing to the disturbances,
students have forsaken the place, and Oxford,
once so renowned, has become "like a worthless fig-tree
without fruit."<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> It has already been pointed out how,
nearly half a century later, the University had not recovered
from the great blow it had received at this period.<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a>
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p211"></a>[p211]</span></p>

<p>There seems, indeed, a prevalent misunderstanding in
regard to the relation, or proportionate numbers, of secular
and regular clergy at this period, and as to the decline in
popularity of the regulars, as presumed to be evidenced in
the number of those who joined them after the middle of
the fourteenth century. It is assumed that up to that
period the regular clergy were, both in numbers and
influence, the chief factors in the ecclesiastical system
of England, and that after that date they greatly declined
in importance, public estimation, and numbers. As evidence,
not only is an actual diminution in mere numbers
adduced, but also the fact that, after this time, the new
religious institutions took the form of colleges, not of
monasteries. The misconception lies first of all in this—that
there never was a period of the middle ages in England,
nor for the matter of that abroad, when the regular clergy
was the great mainstay of the Church, so far, at least, as
numbers, external work, and the cure of souls are concerned.
Writers have allowed their imaginations to be
influenced by the magnitude of the great monastic houses,
or by the prominent part taken in the government of the
Church by individuals of eminence, belonging to the ranks
of the regular clergy; and have not remembered how comparatively
few in fact were these great monastic centres,
and how small a proportion their inmates bore to the great
body of clergy at large.</p>

<p>It is necessary to refer, perhaps, to figures to bring this
home to those who have not devoted special attention to
the mediæval period, or who, having studied it, still somehow
fail to realise facts as distinct from theories, and to
rid themselves of the imaginative prepossessions with
which they entered upon their investigations. Thus, even
after the institution of the mendicant orders, and in the
flow of their popularity, the ordinations for the diocese of
York, in the year 1344–45, show that, whilst the number of
priests ordained was 271, only 44 were regulars. In the same
way, the register of Bishop Stapeldon gives the ordinations
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p212"></a>[p212]</span> in the diocese of Exeter from 1301 to 1321. During this
period 703 seculars were made priests, against 114 regulars.
In both these instances, therefore, more than six seculars
were ordained for every regular.</p>

<p>This has its importance in estimating the change in the
direction given to religious foundations noticed above.
During the course of the thirteenth century, when so strong
a current of intellectual activity and speculation had set in,
the importance of education to the working clergy—at
least to a considerable proportion of them—forced itself
upon those who were the responsible rulers of the Church.
The religious houses were in existence, and, either great
or small, were spread all over the land; indeed, after the
pestilence of 1349, greatly more than sufficed for the number
of vocations in the reduced population. Further, by
their foundation they were not calculated to furnish the
means of meeting the new want that was pressing, aggravated
as it was by the sudden diminution of the pastoral
clergy in the sickness. The formation of collegiate institutions,
whether of the University type or of country
colleges for secular priests, such as Stoke-Clare, Arundel,
and the very many others which arose in the century and
a half from 1350 to 1500, is explained by the very circumstances
of the case; and there is no need to have recourse
to a supposition as to the wane in popularity
of the religious orders, and the prevalent sense that their
work was over, to explain the diminution in their numbers,
and the absence of new monastic foundations. If the
relative proportion between the numbers of secular and
regular clergy ordained before and after the middle of the
fourteenth century be taken as a test of the truth of
this supposition, the statistics available do not bear it
out. Thus the ordinations to the priesthood, registered in
the registers of the diocese of Bath and Wells, for the 80
years, 1443 to 1523, number 901; of these 679 were those
of seculars and 222 those of regulars. In this instance,
consequently, the ordination of seculars to regulars was
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p213"></a>[p213]</span> in the proportion of 8·5 to 2·7, or rather more than three to
one.<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a></p>

<p>In common with those in worldly professions and businesses
the survivors among the clergy appear to have
demanded larger stipends than they had previously obtained
for the performance of their ecclesiastical duties. Looking
back upon the times, and considering how even the small
dues of the clergy had been reduced by the death of a
large proportion of their people, till they became wholly
inadequate for their support, it is impossible to blame them
harshly, and not to see that such a demand must inevitably
follow upon a great reduction in numbers. At the time,
however, by the direction of King and Parliament, the
Archbishops and Bishops sought to restrain them from
making these claims, in the same way as the King tried to
prevent the labourers from demanding higher wages. In
his letter to the Bishops of his province Archbishop Islip
refers "to the unbridled cupidity of the human race," which
ever requires to be checked by justice, unless "charity is
to be driven out of the world." "General complaints have
come to me," he writes, "and experience, the best teacher
of all things, has shown to me that the priests who still
survive, not considering that they are preserved by the
Divine will from the dangers of the late pestilence, not
for their own sakes, but to perform the ministry committed
to them for the people of God, and the public utility," like
other workmen, through cupidity, neglect the burdens of
curates, and take more profitable offices, for which also
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p214"></a>[p214]</span> they demand more than before. If this be not at once put
a stop to "many, and indeed most of the churches, prebends,
and chapels of our and your diocese, and indeed of our
whole Province, will remain absolutely without priests."
To remedy this not only were people urged not to employ
such chaplains, but the clergy were to be compelled under
ecclesiastical censures to serve the ordinary cures at
moderate and usual salaries. It seems not improbable
that this measure may have contributed to draw the sympathies
of the clergy at large more closely to the people in
their struggle for freedom at this period of English history,
when both in the civil and ecclesiastical sphere there was
the same attempt by public law to impose restraints on
natural liberty.</p>

<p>To the great dearth of clergy at this time may, partly at
least, be ascribed the great growth of the crying abuse of
pluralities. Without taking into account the difficulty experienced
on all hands in finding fit, proper, and tried
ecclesiastics to fill posts of eminence and responsibility in
the Church, it is impossible to account for the great increase
in the practice just at this time. The number of benefices,
for example, held by William of Wykeham himself, who
entered the Church in consequence of the great mortality
among the clergy in 1361, may be explained, if not excused,
by the prevalent and in the circumstances inevitable
dearth of subjects of training and capacity equal to the
arduous and delicate duties devolving on the higher clergy.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all the great difficulties which beset the
Church in England in consequence of the great mortality,
there is abundant evidence (which is no part of the present
subject) of untiring efforts on the part of the leading ecclesiastics
to bring back observance to its normal level. This
is evidenced in the institution of so many pious confraternities
and guilds, and in a profuse liberality to
churches and sacred places.</p>

<p>The consequences of the mortality, so far as the monastic
establishments of the country are concerned, have already
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p215"></a>[p215]</span> in the course of the narrative frequently been pointed out.
The same reasons which militated against the recruiting for
the ranks of the clergy generally after the plague are
sufficient explanation of the fact that the religious houses
were never able to regain the ground lost in that fatal year.
Over and above this, moreover, the sudden change in the
tenure of land, brought about chiefly by the deaths of the
monastic tenants, so impaired their financial position, at
any rate for a long period, that they were unable to support
the burden of additional subjects.</p>

<p>To the facts showing how the monasteries were depopulated
by the disease already given may be added the following:—In
1235 the abbey of St. Albans is supposed to have
counted some 100 monks within its walls. In the plague of
1349 the abbot and some 47 of his monks died at one time,
and subsequently one more died whilst at Canterbury, on
his way with the newly-elected abbot to the Roman Curia.
Assuming, therefore, that the community had remained the
same in number as in 1235, St. Albans was at most left
with only 51 members. At the close of the century,
namely, in 1396, some 60 monks took part in election, and
as this number includes the priors of the nine dependent
cells, it would seem that the actual community still remained
only 51. In 1452 there were only 48 professed monks in
the abbey, and at the dissolution of the monastery, nearly
a century later, the number was reduced to 39. This
instance of the way in which the numbers in the monastic
houses were diminished by the sickness, and by its effect
on the general population of the country were prevented
from ever again increasing to their former proportions,
may be strengthened by the case of Glastonbury. This
great abbey of the west of England has ever been regarded
as in many respects the most important of the English
Benedictine houses. It is not too much to suppose that in
the period of its greatest prosperity it must have counted
probably a hundred members. In 1377 the number, as
given on the subsidy-roll, is only 45. In 1456 they stand
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p216"></a>[p216]</span> at 48, and were about the same at the time of the dissolution
of the abbey. A similar effect upon the members at
Bath has already been pointed out.</p>

<p>It need hardly be said that the scourge must have been
most demoralising to discipline, destructive to traditional
practice, and fatal to observance. It is a well-ascertained
fact, strange though it may seem, that men are not as a
rule made better by great and universal visitations of
Divine Providence. It has been noticed that this is the
evident result of all such scourges, or, as Procopius puts
it, speaking of the great plague in the reign of the Emperor
Justinian, "whether by chance or Providential design it
strictly spared the most wicked."<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> So in this visitation,
from Italy to England, the universal testimony of those who
lived through it is that it seemed to rouse up the worst
passions of the human heart, and to dull the spiritual senses
of the soul. Wadding, the Franciscan annalist, has attributed
to this very plague of 1348–9 the decay of fervour evident
throughout his own order at this time. "This evil," he
writes, "wrought great destruction to the holy houses of religion,
carrying off the masters of regular discipline and the
seniors of experience. From this time the monastic orders,
and in particular the mendicants, began to grow tepid and
negligent, both in that piety and that learning in which
they had up to this time flourished. Then, our illustrious
members being carried off, the rigours of discipline relaxed
by these calamities, could not be renewed by the youths
received without the necessary training, rather to fill the
empty houses than to restore the lost discipline."<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a></p>

<p>We may sum up the results of the great mortality in the
words of a recent writer. "For our purpose," writes Dr.
Cunningham, "it is important to notice that the steady
progress of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries was
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p217"></a>[p217]</span> suddenly checked in the fourteenth; the strain of the hundred
years' war would have been exhausting in any case, but the
nation had to bear it when the Black Death had swept off
half the population and the whole social structure was disorganised."<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a></p>

<p>In dealing with this subject it is difficult to bring home
to the mind the vast range of the great calamity, and to
duly appreciate how deep was the break with then
existing institutions. The plague of 1349 simply shattered
them; and it is, as already pointed out, only by perpetual
reiteration and reconsideration of the same phenomena
that we can bring ourselves to understand the character of
such a social and religious catastrophe. But it is at the
same time of the first importance thoroughly to realise the
case if we are to enter into and to understand the great process
of social and religious re-edification, to which the immediately
succeeding generations had to address themselves.
The tragedy was too grave to allow of people being carried
over it by mere enthusiasm. Indeed, the empiric and
enthusiast in the attempts at social reconstruction, as may
be found in the works of Wycliff, could only aggravate the
evil. It was essentially a crisis that had to be met by
strenuous effort and unflagging work in every department
of human activity. And here is manifested a characteristic
of the middle ages which constitutes, as the late Professor
Freeman has pointed out, their real greatness. In contradistinction
to a day like our own, which abounds in every
facility for achievement, they had to contend with every
material difficulty; but in contradistinction, too, to that
practical pessimism which has to-day gained only too great
a hold upon intelligences otherwise vivacious and open,
difficulties, in the middle ages, called into existence only a
more strenuous and more determined resolve to meet and
surmount them. And here is the sense in which the
hackneyed, and in a sense untrue, phrase, "the Ages
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p218"></a>[p218]</span> of Faith," has a real application, for nothing can be more
contrary to the spirit and tone of mind of the whole epoch
than pessimism, nothing more in harmony with it than
hope. In this sense the observation of a well-known
modern writer on art, in noting the inability of the middle
ages to see things as they really are and the tendency
to substitute on the parchment or the canvas conventional
for actual forms, has a drift which, perhaps, he did not
perceive. In itself unquestionably this defect is a real one,
but in practice it possessed a counterbalancing advantage
by supplying the necessary corrective to that bare
literalism and realism which, in the long run, is fatal no
less to sustained effort than it is to art.</p>

<p>The great mortality, commonly called the Black Death,
was a catastrophe sudden and overwhelming, the like of
which it will be difficult to parallel. Many a noble
aspiration which, could it have been realised, and many a
wise conception which, could it have attained its true
development, would have been most fruitful of good to
humanity, was stricken beyond recovery. Still no time
was wasted in vain laments. What had perished was
perished. Time, however, and the power of effort and
work belonged to those that survived.</p>

<p>Two of the noblest churches in Italy typify the twofold
aspect of this great visitation—the Cathedral of Siena and
the Cathedral of Milan. The former, the vast building that
crowns the Tuscan Hill, is but a fragment of what was
originally conceived. It was actually in course of erection,
and would have been hardly less in size than the present
St. Peter's had it been completed. The transepts were
already raised, and the foundations of the enormous nave
and choir had been laid when the plague fell upon the city.
The works were necessarily suspended, and from that day
to this have never been resumed.</p>

<p>Little more than a generation had passed from the fatal
year when the most glorious Gothic edifice on Italian soil
was already rising from the plain of Lombardy—a symbol
<span class="xxpn"><a id="p219"></a>[p219]</span> of new life, new hopes, new greatness, which would surpass
the greatness of the buried past. And this, be it observed,
was no creation of Prince or Potentate; it was essentially
the idea, the work, the achievement of the people of Milan
themselves.<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></p>

<p>What gives, perhaps, the predominant interest to the
century and a half which succeeded the overwhelming
catastrophe of the Black Death is the fact of the wonderful
social and religious recovery from a state almost of dissolution.
It is not the place here even to enter upon so
interesting and important a subject. It must suffice to
have indicated the point of view from which the history of
the immediately succeeding generations must be regarded.
In spite of wars and civil commotions it was an age of
distinct progress, although the very complexity and variety
of current and undercurrent is apt at times to daze the too
impatient inquirer, who wishes to reduce everything to the
simple result of the definitely good, or the definitely bad.</p>

ages. Most of what Mr. Thorold Rogers says is applicable to all
classes of society. Dr. Cunningham (<em class="e000I2">Growth of English Industry and

Of course, several of these would be ordained for other
dioceses, but in the same way Winchester priests would be ordained
by letters dimissory elsewhere, so that taking the whole of England
we may assume a practical equalisation. In the diocese of London, as
already stated (<a href="#FNanchor_322">p. 175</a> <em class="e000I2">ante</em>), the proportion of non-beneficed to
beneficed clergy ordained during 12 years, from 1362 to 1374, was
nearly six to one.</p></div>

Mr. Thorold Rogers' supposition that the population in
1348 was only about 2,500,000 would, on the assumption that the two
sexes were about equal in number, lead to the conclusion that one man
in every 25 was a priest; a suggestion which seems to bear, on the
face of it, its own refutation.</p></div>

Amyot (<em class="e000I2">Archæologia</em>, xx, p. 531) notes that even
soldiers appear to have been better paid than the clergy. A foot
soldier had 3d. a day, or 7 marks a year; a horse soldier 10d. or
12d. a day. Chaucer's good parson, who was only "rich of holy thought
and werk," might not be remarkable.</p></div>

Episcopal Registers. It is of interest to note that in normal times
very few were ordained after their appointment as incumbents. Thus,
to take the churches in the city of Winchester, besides this period
and 1361, when again the mortality among the clergy was very great,
only some 8 or 9 were so ordained between 1349 and 1361, as the
following table will show:—</p>

Archbishop Islip founded Canterbury College at Oxford to
supply the failing ranks of the clergy and to increase the facilities
of learning (Wilkins, iii., p. 52), and William of Wykeham likewise
established his schools and colleges with the same object.</p></div>

In the diocese of London, in the twelve years, from 1362
to 1374, Bishop Sudbury ordained 1,046 seculars and 456 regulars,
the proportion consequently being about 2·3 to 1. In the last twenty
years of the century, namely, from 1381 to 1401, Bishop Braybroke
ordained to the priesthood only 584 seculars, whilst the regulars
were 425 during the same period. In other words, during the first
period, the average annual number of ordinations to the ranks of
the secular clergy in the diocese of London was over 87; during the
last twenty years of the century it was only 29·2. The averages of
the regulars in the corresponding periods were 35 and 21·2. Similar
results appear from the York registers.</p></div>

The <em class="e000I2">Annali della fabbrica</em>, published by the Cathedral administration, show
in the minutest detail the organisation by which the necessary funds were
raised, and enable us to see how it was popular enterprise by which so
noble an undertaking was achieved. We can now realise the weekly collections
made by willing citizens from door to door, the collections in the churches,
the monthly sales of offerings in kind of the most varied nature, jewels,
dresses, linen, pots and pans, divers articles of dress and domestic use. Every
one, rich and poor alike, felt impelled to join in some way in the work which,
as the words of the originators express it, "<em class="e000I2">was begun by Divine inspiration to
the honour of Jesus Christ and His most Spotless Mother</em>." <em class="e000I2">Cf.</em> an article by
Mr. Edmund Bishop on the subject in the <em class="e000I2">Downside Review</em>, July, 1893.</p></div></div>

<a id="TRANSCRIBERS_ENDNOTE"></a>TRANSCRIBER'S ENDNOTE.

<p>Original printed spelling and grammar is generally retained.
Footnotes were renumbered and moved from the ends of pages to the
ends of chapters. Ellipses look like the originals. Original printed
page numbers are shown like these: "[p-xiii]", in the front matter,
or else like "[p013]". Original SMALL CAPS <em class="e00S02">Looks Like</em>
<em class="e0U003">THIS</em>. The transcriber created the cover image,
and transfers it to the public domain.</p>

<p>The page images available to the proofreaders and to the transcriber
were nearly illegible in a few places, especially in the small print
in some footnotes. The first footnote on page <a href="#p157">157</a> is perhaps the
worst example of this: three different images, presumably from three
different printed copies of the book, failed to clarify whether the
correct reading is "Treasury of Receipt 21a/3", as rendered herein,
or not.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p009">9</a>, footnote: "simoon" was printed, and is retained, but perhaps
"simoom" was meant.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p019">19</a>: "northen Italy" changed to "northern Italy".</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p035">35</a>, first footnote: comma inserted between "Austriacarum" and
"Scriptores".</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p040">40</a>: "crosssd" changed to "crossed".</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p061">61</a>: "familes" changed to "families".</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p063">63</a>: "Pfäffers" is spelled "Pfäfers" in the index.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p065">65</a>: "Heiligenkreuz" is spelled "Heiligen Kreuz" in the index.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p080">80</a>: closing quote added to the sentence that ends thus: "the
burial-place of its victims".</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p085">85</a>: "Doulting" is retained, although it is spelled "Doulton" in
the index.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p118">118</a>, etc.: The words "Shereborne" (in the Index), "Sherborne" (p
<a href="#p118">118</a>, <a href="#p163">163</a>), and "Shireborne"
(p <a href="#p185">185</a>, and in the Index) have all been retained,
although two or all three may have the same referent.</p>

<p>Pages 221–244, Index: there are several entries that apparently
refer to locations within the front matter, where page numbers were
designated by Roman numerals. These references generally seem to be
incorrect. For example, under the heading
"<a href="#BlackDeath">Black Death</a>" on page 223, there are four entries that refer the
reader to pages iii or vi, but these pages were the title page and
the second page of the Table of Contents, respectively. Similarly,
under the heading <a href="#Calais">Calais</a>, the reader is referred to page i, which
is the half title page of the printed book. These incorrect references
have been retained.</p>

to agree with text on pages <a href="#p104">104</a> and <a
href="#p106">106</a>.</p>
